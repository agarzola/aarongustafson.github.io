				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honestly, it’s probably good to get into the habit of updating your SSH keys regularly anyway, but in case you needed a reminder:</p>

<blockquote><p>Back in February, we improved the security audit trail for SSH keys. Soon, organizations will be able to block access for SSH keys that were created prior to those improvements. If your application relies on deploy keys or user keys for repository access, we recommend replacing any keys created before February 24, 2014.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great piece on how to carve out time while still working &amp; living.</p>

<blockquote><p>We find the time for those things we place importance on. “Finding the time” often relies upon having a goal that is meaningful and important to you; a goal that is valuable enough to make a priority. If you consistently don’t have time to make progress on your project, take a reality check: is this something you really want to achieve? If you feel it really is a priority for you, move forward by fitting it in with the priorities you share with the people in your life.</p></blockquote>
