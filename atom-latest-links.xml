				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/web-devvy-ways-practice-gratitude-empathy/"/>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A great post from Chris Coyier:</p>

<blockquote><p> I&rsquo;m starting to think empathy really is one of the most valuable skills (if you can call it a skill) that you can have. If you can put yourself in another persons shoes, you can imagine what it&rsquo;s like to use the things you make. That gives you mad UX skills. It means you can write a damn fine support email. You can make a meeting worth having. You can communicate clearly, because you can imagine what it&rsquo;s like to receive that communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>Empathy is where it’s at. Check out his list for ways to increase your &ldquo;devvy&rdquo; empathy.</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/on-use-of-the-lang-attribute/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-26T11:32:05-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/on-use-of-the-lang-attribute</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adrian has put together a great overview of why <code>lang</code> is important and how many sites are using it. Here are a few takeaways:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>VoiceOver on iOS uses the attribute to auto-switch voices.</li>
        <li>VoiceOver can speak a particular language using a different accent when specified.</li>
        <li>Leaving out the `lang` attribute may require the user to manually switch to the correct language for proper pronunciation.</li>
        <li>JAWS uses it to load the correct phonetic engine/phonologic dictionary — Handy for sites with multiple languages.</li>
        <li>NVDA (Windows) uses it in the same way as VoiceOver and JAWS.</li>
        <li>When used in HTML that is used to form an ePub or Apple iBooks document, it affects how VoiceOver will read the book.</li>
        <li>Firefox, IE10, and Safari (as of a year ago) only support CSS `hyphens: auto` when the `lang` attribute is set.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>


<p>Thanks for putting this together Adrian!</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great stuff from some folks who know an awful lot about email:</p>

<blockquote><p>If there&rsquo;s a medium that lends itself to progressive enhancement, it&rsquo;s email. Given the contexts in which email content is parsed and displayed (and will be in the future), it pays to consider content first and independently from the presentation.</p>

<p>Traditionally, email designers have taken all sorts of scrappy approaches to ensuring that text in email &ldquo;looks the same across all clients&rdquo;. Your Gmail experience should be the same as your Outlook experience and so-forth. I&rsquo;d argue that &ldquo;reading the same across all clients&rdquo; is vastly more important and that when possible, visually lovely flourishes should be added, for the environments that support them.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For me, however, the whole thing was a bit of an epiphany about browsers. I’ve always seen browsers as my main playground and got frustrated by lack of standards support across them. I got annoyed by users not upgrading to new ones or companies making that hard. And I was disappointed by developers having their pet browsers to support and demand people to use the same. What I missed out on was how amazing browsers themselves have become as tools for end users.</p></blockquote>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/yawn-ie6-must-die-yawn-dot-dot-dot/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-22T08:17:26-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/yawn-ie6-must-die-yawn-dot-dot-dot</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Way back in 2010, <a href="https://twitter.com/getify">Kyle Simpson</a> proposed that a new version of IE should live beside an older version to allow the new IE to prosper while the old one remains stable for enterprises that require its proprietary features:</p>

<blockquote><p>The IE (Consumer Edition) would at its heart be a very different browser than the IE (Platform Edition). Instead of releasing once every couple of years, IE-CE could release every couple of months. IE-CE could ditch all that legacy JScript extension junk (and ActiveX!) and fully conform to open web standards. They could embrace SVG, <code>canvas</code>, <code>video</code>, CSS3, and all the other amazing things that IE9 is only barely now giving us a glimpse of. Microsoft could stop being the joke of the open web community, stop playing catch up, and actually take the lead in helping innovate in the consumer browser space.</p>

<p>And all the while, they could keep (and from time to time, back-port to) IE-PE stable and reliable for the Platform world. IE-PE would be Microsoft’s proprietary extensions on the open-web consumer browser experience. IE-PE would serve the needs of corporations and sysadmins by giving them stability and security and not be bothered by all the “noise” of the rapidly changing consumer browser market.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wonder if he called it. Will “Project Spartan” live alongside IE11? I guess time will tell.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>PS &ndash; I love this opening rant from that post. I still feel this way, nearly five years later:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am so entirely bored by the “IE6 must die” movement External Link. All you people out there who think you’re on some high horse of morality and rightness for the web’s future — this is a complete waste of effort. It’s useless windbaggery and nonsense. To date, I don’t think a single user has ever upgraded their IE6 simply because some douche-bag developer told them to. You live in a bubble if that’s how you think the real world works.</p>

<p>And while we’re at it, you sites out there who intentionally abandon IE6 support, not because it makes sense for your site (and not because you’ve provided a reasonable fallback graceful degradation for the less fortunate), but instead just because you want to flip the finger at Microsoft… well, you suck. And you know who else sucks? The sites who intentionally employ techniques they know will cause IE6 to crash External Link, as sort of a holier-than-thou “screw you” to a user who still surfs any of the web with IE6.</p>

<p>Then there are those who feel that we can create self-fulfilling prophecies and that will make this problem go away. Or the nagging site banners and twitter icon overlays reminding everyone just how much of a jack ass you are about IE6. Yeah right. Amusing, I guess, but not productive.</p>

<p>Get over yourselves, already. There, I said it. Deal with it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I just give IE6 the mobile layout and no JS and call it a day.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a pretty interesting idea and I see where <a href="https://twitter.com/drpizza">Peter Bright</a> is coming from with this sentiment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Although Microsoft has endeavored to be more open about how it&rsquo;s developing its browser, and which features it is prioritizing, that development nonetheless takes place in private. Developing in the open, with a public bug tracker, source code repositories, and public discussion of the browser&rsquo;s future direction is the next logical step.</p></blockquote>

<p>With Microsoft <a href="https://status.modern.ie/">opening up their process</a> <a href="https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-internet-explorer-platform/">more and more</a>, I wonder if they’ve considered open-sourcing Trident (or whatever is driving <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7863331/microsoft-project-spartan-new-web-browser">“Project Spartan”</a> under the hood).</p>

				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/monday-19-january-2015</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This brilliant piece from Eileen Webb discusses her experience as a woman who has been working in tech since her first internship in 1997. In it, she chronicled a number of incredibly inappropriate work-related activities and situations she has endured—<em>that sucks, Eileen, I’m sorry you had to deal with all that crap</em>—but the point of the post is not to dwell on these. Instead Eileen urges us to listen when women (and I have to imagine any underrepresented group) vent about mistreatment and to reflect on it rather than reacting:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, many women are angry, and injured, and our public seething will make you uncomfortable. Sit with that. Let it wash over you, and through you. Breathe, and feel the urge to squirm, and choose to be still instead. For we who have been living with this discomfort our whole careers, you can handle not-reacting for a few minutes.</p></blockquote>

<p>We need to listen in order to be aware. We need to reflect in order to understand. And when we do that, we can recognize forms of oppression and disrespectful behavior, identify it as such, and stand together in declaring it unacceptable.</p>
