				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cwilso.com/">Chris Wilson</a> is dead-on with this post. The web isn’t native, but it can do native-like things really well and with less friction for our users.</p>

<blockquote><p>The web… excels at just-in-time interaction, as it IS hassle-free. But it’s a natural progression to enable users to move that onto their home screen, and let them get notifications and other engagement features if they so desire. This is still the web, though – I don’t need to have the NYT app open just to read the article at a link I followed. There are also app-like behaviors you may want occasionally too, e.g. a “what’s near me?” app. There’s an assumption that app-like behaviors demand native, and that the web is for documents.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sounds like this was an awesome workshop!</p>

<blockquote><p>George Williams, one of the workshop organizers and author of the chapter “<a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44">Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities” in Debates in the Digital Humanities</a> (2012), offered the example of the curb cut, which, as he says in his chapter, was designed to facilitate wheelchair users crossing the street, but “became recognized as useful also to other people such as someone making a delivery with a dolly, a traveler pulling luggage on wheels, a parent pushing a child in a stroller, or a person walking beside their bicycle.” Williams urged us to recognize the broad benefits of accessible design, while also raising questions about the “universal” in universal design.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Everyone has special needs and not all of them revolve around disabilities.</p>

<p>There will be another <a href="http://www.accessiblefuture.org/">Accessible Futures</a> workshop this Fall. If you have the opportunity, you should go.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I could not agree more with PPK on this: Native apps and websites shouldn’t be in competition. Each has its pros and cons.</p>

<blockquote><p> If the user doesn’t want your icon on his home screen, if the user wants a just-in-time interaction, it’s the web they want — not because of any inherent technological superiority, but because it’s hassle-free. Go there, read, forget. No junk left on your phone.</p>

<p>Most businesses don’t stand a chance of ending up on the users’ home screens. So they need the web — but not a web that emulates native to no particular purpose.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For me, every step forward in making things lighter and smaller is a new obstacle. Often, the buttons I need to hit are too small, the screen too sensitive, or the glare off the screen too distracting to allow me to make use of my device. Updates to operating systems or apps that create slight changes to the size and position of buttons throw me off for days. While these changes might go unnoticed by a typical user, I endure a relearning process that slows me down and makes it more difficult to communicate.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this brief post, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> reminds us of the importance of simplicity by deftly showing us where we’ve gotten ourselves:</p>

<blockquote><p>[D]riven by fear that apps would make the web irrelevant, we began relying on frameworks that made even the simplest website act and feel like a mind-blowing application. Serving reams of code we didn’t need because, hell, it came with the frameworks, and abandoning principles like progressive enhancement because, hell, everybody uses JavaScript, we soon fell in love with high-resolution, full-screen background images, then fell even harder when those images quadrupled in weight thanks to Retina.
And still the little article memorializing the little 5K contest sat online, its lessons forgotten in an arms race wherein the average home page now weighs over 2MB. Put that in your Edge network and smoke it.</p></blockquote>

I was all <em>meh</em> about it, but then I took the course and realized just how much Microsoft cares about privacy. The training was thorough and insightful; it’s not an overstatement to say it truly blew my mind a little. I wish more companies cared as much. In fact, I wish every startup had to go through similar training before they could collect any user data.</p>

<p>Anyway, this new initiative seems pretty cool and I am proud to see Microsoft leading the charge in securing your files online, all the time.</p>

				<link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/media-websites-vs-facebook/"/>
				<updated>2015-05-20T14:59:35-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/media-websites-vs-facebook</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post from <a href="https://twitter.com/fakebaldur">Baldur Bjarnason</a> hits the nail on the head when it comes to the web vs. native. If you work on the web (as I suspect you do since you’re reading this blog), convert &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; to &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote><p>The web doesn’t suck. Your websites suck.</p>

<p><em>All of your websites suck</em>.</p>

<p>You destroy basic usability by hijacking the scrollbar. You take native functionality (scrolling, selection, links, loading) that is fast and efficient and you rewrite it with ‘cutting edge’ javascript toolkits and frameworks so that it is slow and buggy and broken. You balloon your websites with megabytes of cruft. You ignore best practices. You take something that works and is complementary to your business and turn it into a liability.</p>

<p>The lousy performance of your websites becomes a defensive moat around Facebook.</p>

<p>Of course, Facebook might still win even if you all had awesome websites, but you can’t even begin to compete with it until you fix the foundation of your business.</p></blockquote>

<p>This article is long and full of choice quotes and embodied wisdom. You should read it. Twice.</p>
