				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great piece on how to carve out time while still working &amp; living.</p>

<blockquote><p>We find the time for those things we place importance on. “Finding the time” often relies upon having a goal that is meaningful and important to you; a goal that is valuable enough to make a priority. If you consistently don’t have time to make progress on your project, take a reality check: is this something you really want to achieve? If you feel it really is a priority for you, move forward by fitting it in with the priorities you share with the people in your life.</p></blockquote>
