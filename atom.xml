				<updated>2015-07-07T13:58:14-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/ui-fail-how-our-user-interfaces-help-to-ruin-lives</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is full of gold! Here’s a peek:</p>

<blockquote><p>While some of the users had indeed never had much computer experience, a vast number of responses involved highly skilled, technologically-savvy individuals—often engineers themselves—who had helped build the information age but now felt themselves being left behind by Web designers who simply don&rsquo;t seem to care about them at all.</p>

<p>While issues of privacy and security were frequently mentioned in responses, as were matters relating to fundamental service capabilities, issues and problems relating to user interfaces themselves were by far the dominant theme.</p>

<p>Some of these were obvious.</p>

<p>There is enormous, widespread frustration with the trend toward low-contrast interfaces and fonts, gray fonts on gray backgrounds and all the rest. Pretty, but unreadable to many with aging eyes (and keep in mind, visual acuity usually begins to drop by the time we&rsquo;ve started our 20s).</p>

<p>Many respondents noted that screen magnifiers can&rsquo;t help in such situations—they just end up with a big low-contrast blob rather than a small low-contrast blob.</p>

<p>But then we really get into the deeper nitty-gritty of UI concerns. It&rsquo;s a long and painful list.</p>

<p>Hidden menus. Obscure interface elements (e.g., tiny upside-down arrows). Interface and menu elements that only appear if you&rsquo;ve moused over a particular location on the display. Interface elements that are so small or ephemeral that they can be a challenge to click even if you still have the motor skills of youth. The list goes on and on.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A brief but inspiring profile of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/gregsmi/">Greg Smith</a>, a quadriplegic programmer and principal software engineer in Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>This bit was pretty incredible:</p>

<blockquote><p>He puts together the skeleton of whatever section of code he’s working on that day in his mind. Then, using a camera that responds to his head movements and a mouth-controlled mouse and a metal clicker that he&rsquo;s been using for 20 years, he&rsquo;s able to key in the code—letter by letter.
It would take too long to type out the code first and then start rearranging. So that part he does by memory.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another great post from Tim. The sooner we recognize how little we actually control when it comes to our websites, the better we’ll be able to serve our users.</p>

<blockquote><p>Getting a website successfully delivered to a visitor depends on a series of actions. My server must spit something out. That something must be passed over some network. That something must then be consumed by another something: some client (often a browser) on some device. Finally, the visitor views that something in whatever context they happen to be in.</p>

<p>There are a lot of unpredictable layers here.</p></blockquote>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Harvard, MIT, and Captioning]]></title>
				<link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/harvard-and-mit-and-captioning/"/>
				<updated>2015-06-29T14:23:28-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/harvard-and-mit-and-captioning</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has published Statements of Interest in two cases brought by the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) against <a href="http://www.ada.gov/briefs/harvard_soi.pdf">Harvard (PDF)</a> and <a href="http://www.ada.gov/briefs/mit_soi.pdf">MIT (PDF)</a>, respectively. The NAD is suing the two universities for violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because the video and audio materials they are making available as part of their online learning offerings are not captioned.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The DOJ Statements make it quite clear that</p>

<blockquote><p>Both the ADA and Section 504 currently obligate Harvard to provide effective communication to ensure equal access to its online programming services, and resolution of Plaintiffs’ claim involves a straightforward application of longstanding statutory and regulatory requirements. For more than two decades, federal courts have resolved effective communication claims brought under the ADA and Section 504 in a wide range of contexts, including claims alleging unequal access to goods, benefits and services provided through websites or other electronic media. And the Departments of Justice and Education have routinely required covered entities to ensure equal access to goods, benefits and services, electronic or otherwise, through the provision of captioning or other auxiliary aids or services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also…</p>

<blockquote><p>[T]he Department issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”) on Accessibility of Web Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities and Public Accommodations, announcing the Department’s interest in developing more specific requirements or technical standards for  website accessibility. … In the ANPRM, the Department reaffirmed its longstanding position that the ADA applies to websites of public accommodations, and reiterated, consistent with the preamble to the 1991 regulations, that the ADA regulations should be interpreted to keep pace with developing technologies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Neither case has been settled yet, but the fact that the DOJ is siding with the NAD will lend more credence to their complaints and will likely result in one or both institutions settling out of court and, eventually, captioning their videos.</p>

<p>Captions are critical for the deaf and hard of hearing as they let them know what’s being said, who is saying it, how it’s being said, and inform them of any other sounds that are germane to the content. Reading captions is the equivalent of hearing with your eyes.</p>

<p>Are your videos captioned? If your content is aimed at a broad audience, it might be worth your time (and even your money) to get them captioned.</p>

<p>No doubt, accurate captioning is time-consuming. There are some ways of automating it (<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3038280">YouTube does this</a>, for instance), but there are also services like <a href="https://castingwords.com/">Casting Words</a>, <a href="https://www.rev.com/caption">Rev</a>, and <a href="http://www.3playmedia.com/">3Play Media</a> that will do it for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the HTML <code>video</code> element supports subtitles and captions via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track">the <code>track</code> element</a> (<a href="http://www.iandevlin.com/blog/2015/04/html5/html5-video-captions-current-browser-status">browser support</a>, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=track">Can I Use data</a>). YouTube also allows you to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796">add captions and subtitles to your videos manually</a>. But keep in mind that <a href="http://screenfont.ca/learn/">captions and subtitles are not the same thing</a>; captions need to capture more than just the words that are said.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Air travel is a great real-world analogy for progressive enhancement. Kudos to <a href="http://christianheilmann.com">Christian</a> for coming up with it!</p>

<blockquote><p>Progressive enhancement is not about adding more work to your product. It is about protecting the main use case of your product and then enhance it with new functionality as it becomes available. Google is a great example of that. Turn off JavaScript and you still get a form to enter information in and you get a search result page with ads on it. This is how you find things and Google makes money. Anything else they added over time makes it more convenient for you but is not needed. It also offers them more opportunities to show you more ads and point at other services.</p></blockquote>
