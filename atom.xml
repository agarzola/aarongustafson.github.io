				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week the W3C published a couple of really cool new Working Drafts I wanted to bring to your attention (just in case you missed them).</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-pseudo-4-20150115">CSS 4 Pseudo-elements</a>.</h2>

<p>Most of this is stuff you know: <code>::first-line</code>, <code>::first-letter</code>, and <code>::selection</code>. But what magic is this? <code>::spelling-error</code> and <code>::grammar-error</code> too! What?! Now I know I may be a little too excited about this, but it’s not because spelling and grammar errors are going to solve all of our design problems; I am excited about this because it points to us being granted more control over how more of the internals of browser operations are rendered to our users.</p>

<p>Obviously <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/native-vs-stylable-tug-of-war/">this is a double edged sword</a> and could be abused to the detriment of the user experience, but it may also lead to someone coming up with clearer conventions for indicating spelling and grammar errors than the ones we’ve been using since the early days of Microsoft Word.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/">CSS 3 Exclusions</a></h2>

<p>This has been a long time coming. The idea is pretty simple: Within a flow-type element (think <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>, etc.) you can apply <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/#wrap-flow-property">the <code>wrap-flow</code> property</a> to children in order to control where content can go in relation to them. Here’s an example from the spec:</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-01-16-1">
    <img src="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/images/exclusions-illustration.png" alt="Four boxes layed out roughly diagonally from the upper left to the lower right within a larger container. A flow of blue color shows where text is allowed to flow.">
</figure>


<p>In this example, child A is set to <code>wrap-flow: both</code>, allowing content to flow on both sides of it. Child B is set to <code>wrap-flow: start</code> meaning content should only be allowed on the starting side of the element (based on text direction, in this case left to right). Child C is set to <code>wrap-flow: end</code> meaning content can only appear after it in terms of text-direction. And child D is set to <code>wrap-flow: clear</code> which, as you might expect based on your existing CSS knowledge, ensures no content appears on either side of it.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/#wrap-flow-property">another, more thorough example in the Working Draft</a> (scroll down a little bit), but it uses grid layout as well and is a little more complicated that I want to get into today.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the equation, there is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/#wrap-through-property">the <code>wrap-through</code> property</a> which allows other elements to control whether or not they pay attention to the <code>wrap-flow</code> property of another element. A <code>wrap-through</code> value of &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; adheres to what they are calling the &ldquo;wrapping context&rdquo; of the parent element (which basically means it behaves as you’d expect, being a child element). Setting a <code>wrap-through</code> value of &ldquo;none&rdquo; on the child element, however, would make it ignore the parent element’s wrapping context and allow this child’s content to flow through (hence <code>wrap-through</code>) the excluded element.</p>

<p>It’s a lot to take in and (of course) still subject to change, but I just wanted to bring this concept to your attention as it is pretty cool stuff and is a nice complement to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-shapes-1/">CSS Shapes</a>, which landed early last year.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-web-packaging-20150115/">Streamable Package Format</a></h2>

<p>This one is pretty crazy and I am still tucking into it, but here’s the gist: You could provide a &ldquo;package&rdquo; or rolled up collection of files necessary to render your page—think CSS, images, fonts, etc.—in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-web-packaging-20150115/#streamable-package-format">Streamable Package Format</a> which would allow a browser to download them all in one go rather than having to request each resource individually. This could be really useful from a performance standpoint on high-latency connections as it cuts down on the number of round-trips the browser must make to the server before it can render the page. And, since the package can be streamed, we can optimize the contents to provide the most important bits first so the browser can go about rendering the document as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This is a very cool concept with a lot of potential benefit to our users. Of course, as the document acknowledges, it’s also possible to abuse this and adversely affect performance by including a lot of unnecessary content. Kinda like <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/articles/spa.html">that guy who made his whole single-page app into a Web Component</a>. Just because you can do something doesn’t make it a good idea.</p>

<p>Still, there’s a lot of potential here and I’m excited to see where it goes.</p>

<hr>


<p>Now the caveat: all of these are Working Drafts, not Technical Recommendations, so <em>they are not final by any means</em>. That said, they do point to a pretty interesting not to distant future.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[An Onslaught of Low-cost Smartphones]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-onslaught-of-low-cost-smartphones/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-15T11:58:11-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-onslaught-of-low-cost-smartphones</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems every week we are seeing more and more low-cost devices being launched in an effort to connect the unconnected. For instance, this past week  saw the announcement of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7544107/microsoft-lumia-435-532-launch-specs-price-release-date">two new entries in the Microsoft Lumia line, the 435 and the 532</a>, and the announcement of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/samsung-finally-puts-tizen-on-a-smartphone-launches-the-z1-in-india/">Samsung’s first Tizen phone, the Z1</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The two Lumia devices are the cheapest Windows Phone offerings to date: The Lumia 435 is €69 (about US$80) and the Lumia 532 is just slightly more expensive at €79 (about US$94). By comparison, the Lumia 535 was the previous low-cost Windows Phone winner at US$135. And Samsung’s Z1, which is aimed at the Indian market, runs a mere Rs 5,700 (roughly US$92).</p>

<p>Now if you’ve read this far, you are probably wondering why this matters. Well, spec-wise, many of these lower-end devices are far from what we are used to. All of these devices are running a resolution of 800×480. And their processing speeds are slower than the device you likely have in your pocket. But they are all far cheaper too. And remember that people in China and India have <a href="#fig-2015-01-15-01">far less disposible income than we do</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-01-15-01" class="media-container">
    <img src="http://aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2014-11-06/05-sm.jpg"
         srcset="/i/posts/2014-11-06/05-lg.jpg 1920w, /i/posts/2014-11-06/05-md.jpg 600w, /i/posts/2014-11-06/05-sm.jpg 320w"
         alt="A bar chart comparing the average monthly incomes of people living in the U.S., Canada, China, and India."
         >
</figure>


<p>If you only earned US$295 a month, a US$799 smartphone would likely be out of the question.</p>

<p>As Web designers and developers, we need to expose ourselves to the Web as others see it. This is why we need to view our sites and applications on lower-end devices and over lower-speed—2G, 3G, etc.—connections. Only by testing our wares can we truly ensure our content and services are available and accessible by anyone, anywhere, on any device. You know, <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/">the vision for the Web</a>.</p>

<p>Of course you probably don’t have the budget to purchase a bunch of devices, no matter how cheap they are. So how do you test on them? <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">Visit a local Open Device Lab</a> like <a href="http://chadevicelab.org">the one we have here in Chattanooga</a>. Or if you don’t have one near you, consider getting together with some colleagues and <a href="http://lab-up.org/">starting an ODL in your area</a>.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Where Cellular Networks Don&#039;t Exist, People Are Building Their Own]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/where-cellular-networks-dont-exist-people-are-building-their-own/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-14T09:35:30-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/where-cellular-networks-dont-exist-people-are-building-their-own</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a beautiful account of the struggles of bringing cellular networks to poor, rural areas that are uninteresting (e.g. unprofitable) to the major providers.</p>

<blockquote><p>Of the world’s 7 billion or so cell phones, a few hundred of them are already in Yaee—they’re just not connected to a network. Kids use them as cameras and mp3 players, and Hernández, like many adults, bought his to use in Oaxaca City, a seven-hour bus ride away. When he’s there, his cell phone can connect to plenty of base stations, which, in turn, link him to his choice of commercial network. But back in Yaee, there are no base stations and therefore no network. Every time Hernández wants to make a call in his hometown, he hikes for 20 minutes to the top of the highest hill around and hopes to catch some signal trickling in from a faraway base station, installed in a place deemed more profitable for telecoms than small towns like Yaee.</p></blockquote>

<p>Articles like this are a great reminder of how fortunate we are and how our experiences are not universal. They help us empathize with the struggles others must overcome to participate in the “modern world”.</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/9-of-the-worlds-leading-designers-talk-about-what-matters-now/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-14T09:35:19-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/9-of-the-worlds-leading-designers-talk-about-what-matters-now</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A good collection of design-related thinking. Here are some highlights:</p>

<blockquote><p>Great design often disappears, leaving the user with no more than a simple and intuitive experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/gentry">Gentry Underwood</a> of Dropbox. <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool">Jared Spool</a> has been <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/experiencedesign/">beating this drum for ages</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When things are going well in a design, we don&rsquo;t pay attention to them. We only pay attention to things that bother us.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jack Schulze of Berg offered an interesting perspective on design permenance:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I was studying graphic design in the late &lsquo;90s, there was a dream that as a designer, if you were good enough, you might create an archetype for the age—the sorts of things you see in <cite class="movie">Mad Men</cite>, artifacts and images that characterize an era. But when I graduated, it became abundantly clear that when people looked back on the decade to come, they would not be looking at record covers or chairs. It was going to be glowing rectangles and software. People would remember the aesthetics and noises of operating systems, the first time they pinch-zoomed something, the aesthetics of Google Maps, the Nokia ringtone, and Candy Crush Saga.</p></blockquote>

<p>Closing out the piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexislloyd">Alexis Lloyd</a> of the <cite>New York Times</cite> R+D Lab offered an area of concern (and a challenge to designers everywhere):</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re seeing new relationships emerging between people and technology. Algorithms influence an ever-increasing number of facets of our lives: the media we consume, what our health insurance knows about our physical condition, whether we&rsquo;re approved for loans or hired for jobs, and whom we may date or marry. But we don&rsquo;t have much agency in those interactions. These “smart” systems are black boxes, eschewing transparency in favor of simplicity. But when we can&rsquo;t interrogate a system, that disenfranchises us. Designers now must facilitate interactions that balance ease of use with transparency.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since re-starting my blog I’ve been continuing to tinker with Octopress and Jekyll in an effort to customize things a bit more to my liking.</p>

<p>I recently began posting links (with commentary) in a bit of a link blog, but I wasn’t really happy with having it mixed in with the rest of my Notebook posts. I finally took a few minutes to formally bust out the links into <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/">their own paginated section</a>, so you can keep up with them independently. I also set up a three distinct Atom feeds to let you consume this site’s content how you want to: <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/atom.xml">Latest 20 posts and links</a>, <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/atom-latest-posts.xml">latest 20 posts</a>, and <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/atom-latest-links.xml">Latest 20 links</a>.</p>

<p>I’m hopeful this organization will prove as helpful to you as it is for my compartmentalization anxiety.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[webOS Is Back]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/webos-is-back/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-08T10:17:09-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/webos-is-back</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may not remember it, but Palm’s groundbreaking—yes, I said groundbreaking—operating system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">webOS</a>, has been resuscitated yet again. This time by LG.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For those of you who may have missed out on webOS in the past, here’s a primer: webOS was developed by Palm and debuted on the Palm Pre in 2009. It was the first “HTML5-based” operating system. Yes you read that right: the OS was built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In 2009. Six. Years. Ago.</p>

<p>Applications for webOS were written using the front-end Web stack, with the JavaScript application logic tied into the device via the Mojo—and later Enyo—JavaScript application framework. Though novel at the time, this concept has since taken off in the intervening years. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn631758.aspx">Windows</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/">Firefox OS</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=build%20native%20apps%20with%20html5">countless “unified” native app development platforms</a> have embraced the front-end Web stack as a means of building software.</p>

<p>webOS also supported multitasking, which was not common back then. And to make it easy to manage, webOS introduced the brilliant card metaphor for viewing and switching between running applications. Apple, of course, ripped that idea off for iOS 7. If you dig that feature on your iPhone you have Palm to thank.</p>

<p>Sadly, Palm usage was on the decline when webOS debuted so operating system never really took off. Eventually Palm was engulfed by HP, which launched the ill-fated HP TouchPad. It too failed to gather any steam and we thought webOS was dead (despite many proclamations to the contrary from well-meaning folks at HP).</p>

<p>In 2013 <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4027814/hp-emerges-as-big-winner-in-webos-sale">HP announced it was selling parts of webOS to LG</a> for use in smart TVs. It was a glimmer of hope for the beleaguered OS. And now, not only do we have webOS based <a href="http://www.lg.com/uk/smarttv/webos">smart TVs</a>, but <a href="http://gizmodo.com/lgs-new-smart-watch-is-powered-by-webos-1678191522">LG’s new smart watches are sporting the OS as well</a>. And LG has not ruled out bringing it back for a phone either.</p>

<p>I’m happy to see webOS sticking around. It may have been the laughing stock in the app development community back in the day, but I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for it.</p>

<p>I think one of the main reasons the book has remained relevant for so long is because at its core, <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> is a <em>philosophy</em> book. Sure, there are some code examples here and there, but they only serve to demonstrate how you can apply progressive enhancement in your work. The philosophy of progressive enhancement works and only continues to demonstrate its brilliance with each new Web-enabled screen that debuts in the ever-expanding global marketplace. In fact, I’ll go out on a limb and declare that progressive enhancement is probably even more relevant today than it was when I wrote <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> in 2010.</p>

<p>As such, I’ve been thinking a lot about an update. So much has happened since mid-2010 when I was writing the book. Heck, I didn’t even address Responsive Web Design and only touched a little on mobile. Then there are things like single-page apps &amp; isomorphic JavaScript I’d love to discuss. <a href="http://opengraphprotocol.org/">Open Graph</a> &amp; <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>… new tweaks to <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">the ARIA spec</a>… <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element"><code>picture</code></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#attr-img-srcset"><code>srcset</code></a> &amp; <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#attr-img-sizes"><code>sizes</code></a>… the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/">shadow DOM</a>… <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/">web components</a>… the list goes on and on. Progressive enhancement can help you better understand the pros and cons of all of these new advances and help you employ them while simultaneously keeping your projects on time and on budget.</p>

<p>My hope is that the second edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> will be out an in your hands by the end of 2015. But in the meantime, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/4956">taking a page from Jeremy</a>, I felt it was time to give away the first edition. You can now <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/">read <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite></a>, in it’s entirety, from the comfort of your own browser… for free.</p>

<p>The HTML version of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> is a nearly direct port of the XHTML I wrote for the hand-coded ePub. I made a few tweaks to make it a little more readable in the browser, but it’s all there including the videos. And yes, it makes use of progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it and I look forward to getting you the revised and expanded second edition in the not to distant future.</p>

<p>PS &ndash; Easy Readers closed up shop at the end of 2014 and delivered the remaining paperback copies—of which there are only 50 or so—to me. If you missed out on getting a copy and would like to purchase one, <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/contact/">drop me a line</a> and I can sell you one. I’ll even sign it for you!</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/we-need-more-empathy/"/>
				<updated>2014-12-28T11:17:21-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/we-need-more-empathy</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while now I’ve been <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/designing-with-empathy-breaking-development-nashville-2013">beating the “empathy” drum</a> (<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1810">notes</a>), trying to get folks in our industry to understand the importance of creating connections with the people for whom we build software, websites, etc. After all, we design and build tools to solve the needs of actual people, not some generic “user”.<!-- more --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s tough to connect with other people and we often fall into the trap of designing products for us and people like us. Jeffrey Zeldman characterizes the problem perfectly in <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/12/28/unexamined-privilege-is-the-real-source-of-cruelty-in-facebooks-your-year-in-review/">his recent post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If we keep throwing only young, mostly white, mostly upper middle class people at the engine that makes our digital world go, we’ll keep getting camera and reminder and hookup apps—things that make an already privileged life even smoother—and we’ll keep producing features that sound like a good idea to everyone in the room, until they unexpectedly stab someone in the heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>Empathy is difficult when we are surrounded by others like us. We need to be surrounded by different people. Certainly gender and ethnic diversity is incredibly important here, but so is diversity of experience. As Jeffrey astutely points out, diversity in the room where Facebook’s “Year in Review” concept was given the green light would have—I have to hope—helped create some safeguards to keep some of their actual customers from being reminded of tragedies they experienced this year.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, the worst thing they probably discussed was an embarrassing hookup being celebrated, but I’ve had several friends lose children and loved ones this year, other friends battling serious illnesses, and still others who have suffered losses of different sorts. All bore their souls on Facebook in the past year and this feature has brought it back and, in some cases, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/">celebrated these tragic events in a very uncanny and dispassionate way</a>.</p>

<p>And Facebook isn’t the only company to blame for this sort of thing. Pretty much every social network suffers from similar issues. Reading the comments on the various press accounts of this story have revealed similar problems at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/facebook-apologizes-for-morbid-results-with-its-year-in-review-nag/?comments=1&amp;post=28196195#comment-28196195">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/facebook-apologizes-for-morbid-results-with-its-year-in-review-nag/?comments=1&amp;post=28196709#comment-28196709">Google+</a>, <a href="http://www.deathanddigitallegacy.com/2010/08/05/twitter-recommends-dead-friends/">Twitter</a>, and others. We can and need to do better.</p>

<p>In order to address these issues, we need to flex our empathetic muscles. We need to create connections with people who are not like us. People who live in different neighborhoods. People who come from different countries. People who require alternate means to accessing our sites and services. We need to see that the world is full of differences.</p>

<p>Life is full of great joy as well as great tragedy. When we acknowledge diversity of experience and actually embrace it, we become better designers.</p>

<p>I don’t mind the aggregate “users”, but “user” is too clinical and distanced for my tastes. Terms like “the user” keep us from connecting with the people who actually use our software and when we are disconnected from our users, we will not do a great job of solving their problems. And solving problems is the whole point of design.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/autoplay-dont-do-it/"/>
				<updated>2014-12-21T15:12:50-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/autoplay-dont-do-it</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/04/facebooks-autoplay-has-led-to-a-60-boost-in-traffic-on-mobile-networks/">GogOm reported on how Facebook’s decision to autoplay videos led to a 60% increase in mobile data usage</a>. It was a business decision with the intent of increasing engagement, but it was a bad decision from a user experience. It’s a tax on users and they weren’t to happy about it.</p>

<p>You may be wondering <em>Why is this a bad thing for users? They want to see videos, so we’re just giving them what they want.</em> Well, let me share a little story.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I was in Lisbon for <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/uxlx/">UxLx</a> last year and was on roaming data through my mobile provider. At the hotel, the Wifi was giving me trouble, so I opted to tether my computer so I can pull down a document I needed. Chrome crashed. Lame, but no big deal. I relaunched it and, Chrome being the helpful browser that it is, all of my tabs were restored and I got back to work.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I got a text message from my provider: I’d just used a tremendous amount of my data in a very short amount of time. And I had only landed an hour before. I was understandably concerned. And perplexed. What happened?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out one of the tabs that re-spawned after Chrome crashed was a page on YouTube. And on that page was an hour-long video. In HD. And it auto-played. I had the volume off and it was in background tab, so I had no idea.</p>

<p>YouTube’s “business decision” to autoplay their videos cost me real money. A lot of it.</p>

<p>Don’t autoplay. Any benefits you might see in user engagement are probably going to be drowned out by legitimate complaints from your users. Just don’t do it.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/633446180035470">disable auto-play in Facebook</a>, but first of all you have to know it’s an option. Facebook gives you the choice of turning it on or off entirely or to turn it on only over Wifi. That may seem like a great compromise, but I’d like to put forward a few arguments as to why it’s not:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Tethering:</em> If I am tethered to my phone, it is likely being done over Wifi. Even if my browser is aware that I am on Wifi and even if the website is paying attention to that (using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/">Network Informaion API</a>), the website is probably going to get a false positive for Wifi even though the <em>actual</em> data connection is over a mobile network.</li>
<li><em>Metered Wifi:</em> Hotels and other providers often limit how much data you can use. You could be on an awesomely fast Wifi network, but if you are limited to 100MB—it happens—being on Wifi doesn’t matter.</li>
</ol>


<p>So again: Autoplay, don’t do it.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Visualizing CSS3 Transformations]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/visualizing-css3-transformations/"/>
				<updated>2014-12-18T16:53:18-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/visualizing-css3-transformations</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s pretty amazing what you can do with <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms">CSS3 transforms</a> these days, but I often struggle with explaining the importance of function order when I am training people on how to use them. Transformation functions are a visual thing, so they require a visual tool to fully understand them and the implications of your function order decisions.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To address this need, I put together <a href="http://codepen.io/aarongustafson/full/jEryLV/">a tool that dissects CSS3 transforms</a> so the transform process would be more clear for my students. I decided to throw it up on Codepen so you could learn from it as well. Why don’t you open that link and I’ll explain how it works. (Obviously, you’ll need to be in <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d">a browser that supports transforms</a> for the tool to be useful to you.)</p>

<p>The tool starts you off with a simple three-function <code>transform</code> that includes both <code>translate</code> and <code>rotate</code> functions. If you hit the &ldquo;Show Me&rdquo; button, the browser will draw a box and step you through the application of the <code>transform</code> functions, one by one, animating their application so it’s easy to follow. This makes it pretty clear why an element ends up where it does.</p>

<p>Beside the &ldquo;Show Me&rdquo; button is the &ldquo;Rearrange&rdquo; button. It does exactly what you’d think: It rearranges the functions into a new, random order. If you press it and then press &ldquo;Show Me&rdquo; again, you can see if (and why) the element ends up in a different place. The original box remains ghosted out so you can see any differences.</p>

<p>Here’s a video of me playing around with the default <code>transform</code> stack:</p>

<p><figure id="fig-114921831" class="figure figure--video"><div class="video-embed video-embed--vimeo video-embed--16x9"><a class="video-embed__lazy-link" style="background-image:url(http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/500772734_1280.jpg)" href="//vimeo.com/114921831" data-lazy-video-src="//player.vimeo.com/video/114921831?autoplay=1"><div class="video-embed__lazy-div"></div><div class="video-embed__lazy-info">Dissecting CSS3 Transforms</div></a></div></figure></p>

<p>Have a play and let me know your thoughts. I hope you find this tool as helpful as I (and my students) have.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Indecisiveness and URLs]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/indecisiveness-and-urls/"/>
				<updated>2014-12-16T10:23:15-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/indecisiveness-and-urls</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you know me, you know I am a pretty indecisive guy. It is not uncommon for <a href="https://twitter.com/shirleytemper">Kelly</a> and I to spend 15 minutes or more just trying to figure out where we want to grab a meal.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What I’m trying to say (or rather excuse) is that I have been struggling with some of my initial decisions with respect to URLs on this site and finally decided to make some changes before too many links to its content get out there. I was a bit reluctant to do so as we all know <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">what Sir Tim Berners-Lee says</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Cool URIs don’t change.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, consider me uncool as I decided to change some things around here:</p>

<ol>
<li>I dropped the year indicator from blog post URLs. I realized that the likelihood of me having two posts with the same name was pretty much nil, so it was unnecessary to disambiguate like that. Plus it would save me from having to create the annual archives I would feel compelled to make in order to justify the “2014” directory in the URL.</li>
<li>I consolidated my book and article pages to <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/publications">a single page or publications</a>. I thought it might be nice to maintain them separately, but in retrospect that seems unnecessarily complicated.</li>
<li>I changed the URL to my speaking engagements from “events” to “speaking-engagements” as it just made more sense.</li>
</ol>


<p>On the off chance you ever consider changing URLs on a Jekyll or Octopress site, I thought I’d share my process.</p>

<h2>Redirecting Old Links</h2>

<p>I was quite concerned concerned about old links being broken in this site. It’s just not a good thing to do.</p>

<p>In a traditional hosting scenario, I could use <code>.htaccess</code> to set up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302">302 redirects</a>, but I am hosting on Github so that isn’t an option. On top of that, this site is built using Octopress (and Jekyll), so there is no dynamic system in place to programmatically manage those redirects.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there is <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from">a plugin for Jekyll to manage redirects</a>. With it, you can redirect from an an existing page in the YAML front matter using the <code>redirect_to</code> key or you can use the <code>redirect_from</code> key in the YAML front matter on the destination page. I ended up using the former for old pages (articles, books, and events), and the latter for blog posts.</p>

<p>The plugin covers all the bases. It generates pages at the old URLs that redirect using the good old <code>meta</code> refresh, a JavaScript redirect, and a fallback link just in case neither of those work. Oh, and it sets the new URL as the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en">canonical reference</a> to boot.</p>

<p>Done and done.</p>

<h2>Keeping Webmentions</h2>

<p>As I mentioned a few weeks back, I wrote <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/enabling-webmentions-in-jekyll/">a Jekyll plugin to enable webmentions</a>. As web mentions are tied to the “mentioned” URL, changing a post’s URL was going to cause me to lose any previous webmentions. I didn’t like that idea, so <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/31">I talked to Aaron about adding multiple URL support to the webmention.io API</a> and he agreed it was a good idea.</p>

<p>The feature landed late last week and I adjusted <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io">my Jekyll Webmention.io plugin</a> to allow you to supply multiple URLs. While I was at it, I did some other upgrades: I added caching, downloading of webmention titles if the API didn’t supply one, and a test for the existence of avatars before inserting them (so you don’t end up with missing images).</p>

<p>If you were using the plugin, I definitely recommend upgrading as it performs a lot better now. I also added <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io/blob/master/webmention.Rakefile">a Rake task for sending webmentions</a> which is super handy.</p>

<h2>Pardon My Dust</h2>

<p>I apologize for changing URLs on you, but I am hopeful this will be the last major change on the site. As it (currently) says at the top, <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-grand-experiment/">this is an open redesign</a>, so there are bound to be a few bumps here and there. That said, I will try to keep them to a minimum in the future.</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/adaptive-images-in-expressionengine-with-ce-image/"/>
				<updated>2014-11-21T18:18:23-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/adaptive-images-in-expressionengine-with-ce-image</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest headaches of responsive design has been dealing with images. Thankfully our work on the <a href="http://ricg.io">Responsive <del>Images</del> <ins>Issues</ins> Community Group</a> has resulted in a rock-solid set of elements and attributes to address all of your adaptive image needs. My company, <a href="http://easy-designs.net">Easy Designs</a>, recently redesigned <a href="http://www.nichols.edu">Nichols College’s website</a> and that project just happened to coincide adaptive images landing in <a href="http://www.chromium.org/blink">Blink</a> (the rendering engine that powers Chrome and Opera). Naturally, we jumped at the opportunity to use them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Most Nichols College sites run on <a href="http://ellislabs.com/expressionengine">EllisLab’s ExpressionEngine</a>, a solid little workhorse of a CMS we’ve been using for years. We love it because it gives us complete control over the markup it generates. Now EE offers some pretty decent file management and image manipulation utilities out of the box, but the options it provides were not enough to handle our adaptive image needs; we needed backup. <a href="http://www.causingeffect.com/software/expressionengine/ce-image">Causing Effect’s CE Image</a> add-on is reasonably priced and offered exactly the functionality we needed to make our adaptive image dreams a reality.</p>

<p>I won’t bore you with how to set up CE Image as there is <a href="http://www.causingeffect.com/software/expressionengine/ce-image/user-guide">documentation on that</a>, but I will walk you through two different responsive image use-cases we had and how we addressed them using this add-on.</p>

<h2>Header images</h2>

<p>The first use case we had was a series of large, focal images. You can find different examples of them on <a href="http://www.nichols.edu">the homepage</a> and landing pages (like <a href="http://www.nichols.edu/admissions/">this one for Admissions</a>). The first pass on making these images adaptive involved the <code>picture</code> element for which <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#adaptive-images">the spec</a> is known. The markup we were generating was based on the pattern outlined for <a href="http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/">Picturefill</a>, a JavaScript polyfill that implements adaptive images in browsers that don’t do it natively:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=picture-result.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;picture class=&quot;page__image-header__photo&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;&lt;video style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;about_940_343_int_s_c1_full.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 40em)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;about_800_350_int_c1_medium.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 20em)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;about_480_350_int_c1_small.jpg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      document.write(&#39;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;{made}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&#39;);
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;noscript&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;noscript-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{made}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>To get to that point, however, we needed to use CE Image to generate (and cache) the specific sizes we needed:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=picture-element.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;picture class=&quot;page__image-header__photo&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;&lt;video style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{content_focal_image}&quot;
        filename_suffix=&quot;_full&quot;
        width=&quot;940&quot;
        allow_scale_larger=&quot;yes&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        }
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;{made}&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 40em)&quot;&gt;
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{content_focal_image}&quot;
        filename_suffix=&quot;_medium&quot;
        width=&quot;800&quot;
        height=&quot;600&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        }
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;{made}&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 20em)&quot;&gt;
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{content_focal_image}&quot;
        filename_suffix=&quot;_small&quot;
        width=&quot;480&quot;
        height=&quot;360&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        }
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;{made}&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            document.write(&#39;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;{made}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&#39;);
        &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;noscript&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;noscript-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{made}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/noscript&gt;
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
&lt;/picture&gt;
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Not what’s a lot of code, so let’s just look at one segment of that jumble:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=picture-excerpt.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>{exp:ce_img:pair
    src=&quot;{content_focal_image}&quot;
    filename_suffix=&quot;_full&quot;
    width=&quot;940&quot;
    allow_scale_larger=&quot;yes&quot;
    crop=&quot;yes&quot;
    interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
    cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
    }
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;{made}&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 40em)&quot;&gt;
{/exp:ce_img:pair}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This is an example using CE Image’s tag pair option, which lets you control the markup output. In the opening tag, we set several properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>src</code> is the path to the original image uploaded by content authors;</li>
<li><code>filename_suffix</code> is the suffix we want added to the cached file to differentiate it from others in the cache (and make the files more easily scannable);</li>
<li><code>width</code> is our desired output width for the generated image;</li>
<li><code>allow_scale_larger</code> does exactly what you’d expect: it dictates whether or not CE Image should scale the image to reach the desired width;</li>
<li><code>crop</code> tells CE Image whether it’s okay to crop the image;</li>
<li><code>interlace</code> tells CE Image to use image interlacing (which can speed load time); and</li>
<li><code>cache_dir</code> tells CE Image where to store the cached image (in relation to our global configuration)</li>
</ul>


<p>Then, within the tag pair is the <code>source</code> element with the <code>srcset</code> value set to the path to the file CE Image generated (referenced by the <code>made</code> variable) and the associated media query.</p>

<p>Multiply that a few times for the different sizes and you have the full <code>picture</code> element.</p>

<p>Now that’s all well and good, but shortly after launch, <a href="http://ericportis.com/">Eric Portis</a> wrote <a href="http://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/">an amazing post explaining how the <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes operate</a> and it cleared up a lot of my confusion on the matter. He convinced me that the age-old <code>img</code> element, with these new attributes, would be far more maintainable. With a fire in my belly, I rewrote the markup:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=simple-resize.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;img class=&quot;page__image-header__photo&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{embed:image}&quot;
        filename_suffix=&quot;_small&quot;
        width=&quot;480&quot;
        height=&quot;320&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        } 
        src=&quot;{made}&quot;
        srcset=&quot;{made} 480w,
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{embed:image}&quot;
        filename_suffix=&quot;_medium&quot;
        width=&quot;800&quot;
        height=&quot;600&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        }
        {made} 800w,
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{embed:image}&quot;
        filename_suffix=&quot;_full&quot;
        width=&quot;940&quot;
        allow_scale_larger=&quot;yes&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        }
        {made} 940w&quot;
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
    &gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The CE Image behavior is exactly the same, but the resulting markup is much clearer:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=srcset-result.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;img class=&quot;page__image-header__photo&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;
     src=&quot;about_480_320_int_c1_small.jpg&quot;
     srcset=&quot;about_480_320_int_c1_small.jpg 480w,
             about_800_350_int_c1_medium.jpg 800w,
             about_940_343_int_s_c1_full.jpg 940w&quot;&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The added bonus of this approach is that I am not hard-coding any media queries and the browser gets to make the ultimate decision of which image to request. All I am doing is telling the browser the image options and their respective widths within the <code>srcset</code> attribute. As all of the images take up 100% of their containers, I didn’t even need to use the <code>sizes</code> attribute. Easy peasy.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Nice to Have&rdquo; Images</h2>

<p>Not every image adds something to the page. Some are purely optional, a visual enhancement. In order to reduce the size of pages on smaller screens, we often choose to &ldquo;lazy load&rdquo; certain image assets after page load, when we know there is enough room to display the image or when we feel it would be an enhancement to the design.</p>

<p>Now some of you might be wondering: <em>Why not just <code>display:none</code> below a certain threshold?</em> Well, I’ll tell you: images that are hidden with CSS are still requested by the browser. That means users who don’t see the images are still paying to download them (whether in terms of time waiting for the page to render or actual money on a metered connection). That kinda sucks for them. We should show our users a bit more respect and only request the images when we need them.</p>

<p>We wrote <a href="https://github.com/easy-designs/easy-lazy-images.js">a lazy-loading image script</a> a few years back and have battle tested it on numerous sites to great success. It’s all based on a simple markup pattern:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=lazy-loaded-markup.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;module__image image--lazy&quot;
     data-image-src=&quot;Tim-Smith_220x140_220_140_int_c1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The <code>data-img-src</code> attribute defines the path to the &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; image and then the JavaScript adds the image element into the page when the appropriate conditions are met:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=lazy-loaded-result.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;module__image image--lazy&quot;
    data-image-src=&quot;Tim-Smith_220x140_220_140_int_c1.jpg&quot;
    data-image-loaded=&quot;&quot;
    &gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;Tim-Smith_220x140_220_140_int_c1.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Pretty simple. It even supports <code>srcset</code>:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=lazy-loaded-srcset.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;module__image image--lazy&quot;
     data-image=&quot;about_480_320_int_c1_small.jpg&quot;
     data-image-srcset=&quot;about_480_320_int_c1_small.jpg 480w,
                      about_800_350_int_c1_medium.jpg 800w,
                      about_940_343_int_s_c1_full.jpg 940w&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/easy-designs/easy-lazy-images.js#usage">full documentation is up on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Implementing this in the context of CE Image was a breeze and builds on the <code>source</code> pattern I showed earlier:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/96dd157a0206d59ac30a.js?file=lazy-loading.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>{if testimonial_photo}
    {exp:ce_img:pair
        src=&quot;{testimonial_photo}&quot;
        width=&quot;223&quot;
        height=&quot;140&quot;
        allow_scale_larger=&quot;yes&quot;
        crop=&quot;yes&quot;
        interlace=&quot;yes&quot;
        cache_dir=&quot;/&quot;
        }
        &lt;div class=&quot;module__image image--lazy&quot; data-image-src=&quot;{made}&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    {/exp:ce_img:pair}
{/if}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>We are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible with adaptive images and I am sure we will come up with newer, better ways to do this stuff. Heck, there may even be an adaptive images add-on in the pipeline for ExpressionEngine. But, in the meantime, if you are trying to implement adaptive images with ExpressionEngine, CE Image is a good way to go.</p>
