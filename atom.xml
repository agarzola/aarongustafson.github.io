				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Lawson is dead-on with his critique of <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2015AprJun/0225.html">Apple’s feedback on Web Components</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Implementation is hard. Too hard for the developers at Apple, it appears. So Web developers must faff around adding ARIA and tab index and keyboard listeners (so most won’t) and the inevitable consequence of making accessibility hard is that assistive technology users will suffer.</p></blockquote>

<p>We (browser makers and web developers) need to be willing to put in the effort to make things better for everyone else. <a href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/who-should-pay/">Sadly, few seem interested</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for calling this out Bruce!</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Abstraction can be helpful, but it also complicates things and leads to slower performance. <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection">Andrea Giammarchi</a> provides lots of details here in examining a complex app scenario with the good old fashioned DOM vs. a handful of frameworks. Bonus points for the fact that most of the video evidence tests are being run on non-iOS devices!</p>

<blockquote><p>No, the DOM is not your problem, the fact you brought an over-engineered abstraction on top of a deadly simple task, like a table that needs some quick update, is the real problem you don&rsquo;t want to see.</p></blockquote>

				<link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/tips-for-surviving-googles-mobilegeddon/"/>
				<updated>2015-04-21T09:10:12-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/tips-for-surviving-googles-mobilegeddon</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the day <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21648947-worlds-biggest-search-engine-shakes-up-its-algorithms-mobilegeddon">Google updates it algorithm to take into account mobile-friendliness</a>. Here are a few tips that will help you embrace mobile without tearing your hair out.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Embrace mobile-first CSS</h2>

<p>This is a quick win. I’ve done the mobile-first overhaul on a number of existing sites over the last few years and the best strategy I’ve found is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create two CSS files. Name the first something like &ldquo;basic.css&rdquo; and link to it with <code>media="all"</code>. Name the second something like &ldquo;advanced.css&rdquo; and link to it with <code>media="only screen"</code>.</li>
<li>Move all of your existing desktop-only CSS into advanced.css and wrap the rules in a media query corresponding to your design width (e.g. <code>@media (min-width:60em)</code> for a 960px max width).</li>
<li>Open a page from your site in a new browser window and make it as small as possible. Move any basic typographic and color styles from advanced.css to default.css and refresh the page. How does it look? Make the browser wider. Still acceptable? Awesome! This is the CSS you’ll serve to older browsers that don’t understand media queries and it forms the basis of your larger screen styles.</li>
<li>Shrink the browser back down to the smallest it can go and create a breakpoint for that size in advanced.css (e.g. <code>@media (min-width:10.5em)</code> if you want to small target devices like the <a href="https://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a>). Move any styles you want applied in this scenario from your &ldquo;full screen&rdquo; breakpoint and add any new rules you need to make things look good.</li>
<li>Increase the browser width until the layout looks odd, then make a new breakpoint and move in or add the necessary styles.</li>
<li>Rinse &amp; repeat until you get up to the &ldquo;full screen&rdquo; layout.</li>
<li>Move your print styles—you do have print styles, right?—into default.css and wrap them in a print <code>@media</code> block.</li>
</ol>


<p>For another approach to responsive retrofitting, check out <a href="http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/responsive-retrofitting/">this piece from Ben Callahan</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Focus on key tasks</h2>

<p>Every page has a purpose. If it doesn’t, you don’t need it. Find the page’s purpose and make that the focus. Eliminate distractions and reduce the amount of friction a user encounters when trying to accomplish the task.</p>

<p>If company or client politics preclude you from getting rid of all distractions on a page, consider <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax-includes-modular-content.html">a lazy-loading strategy</a> to bring them in with JavaScript only when there is more screen real estate.</p>

<h2>3. Get smarter about images</h2>

<p>Images are great, but they often comprise the majority of a web page’s bulk. To slim things down, first consider whether a given image is actually needed. If it isn’t, get rid of it. If it offers an enhancement, but isn’t crucial, consider lazy-loading it after page load. If the image is really important, <a href="https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/">use <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code></a> (or the <code>picture</code> element) to deliver the smallest and yet most appropriate image to your users, based on their device.</p>

<h2>4. Embrace the continuum</h2>

<p>As designers and developers, we often try to control everything. But we have to realize that we can’t control everything on the Web. People on different devices have different capabilities and considerations. They will need your website to be flexible enough to allow them to accomplish their goals no matter what.</p>

<p>Understanding that is key to building experiences that move seamlessly across devices. You know, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a>. It’s key to embracing the Web for all of its inherent web-iness.</p>

<hr>


<p>And there you have it: 4 simple, but effective guidelines for creating awesome websites that will fair well under Google’s new algorithm. And guess what: Your users will benefit too.</p>

To <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/joe-mullin/">Joe Mullin</a> of <cite>Ars</cite> it seemed like a question of whether a website constitutes a “public accommodation”, but I don&rsquo;t know that it does in this instance. I did agree with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_the_Blind_v._Target_Corp"><cite>NFB v. Target</cite></a>, but this seems different.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Netflix should have to provide captions for all content on its service. The onus for captioning should be on the content creator and not the delivery service. In other words, if Netflix has an accessible site and captions their own original content, that should be the most anyone could ask of them. They don&rsquo;t own the majority of their content and could even be legally precluded from captioning it depending on the contract.</p>

<p>As much as I want to see more captioned content made available, I think the ruling makes sense. The case doesn&rsquo;t seem to be appropriately grounded nor does the ask seem reasonable.</p>

				<updated>2015-04-02T18:51:36-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/why-stem-wont-make-us-successful</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A fantastic op-ed by Fareed Zakaria on why a well-rounded populace is a good thing:</p>

<blockquote><p>A broad general education helps foster critical thinking and creativity. Exposure to a variety of fields produces synergy and cross fertilization. Yes, science and technology are crucial components of this education, but so are English and philosophy.</p></blockquote>

<p>And on innovation for the future of the U.S.:</p>

<blockquote><p>Innovation is not simply a technical matter but rather one of understanding how people and societies work, what they need and want. America will not dominate the 21st century by making cheaper computer chips but instead by constantly reimagining how computers and other new technologies interact with human beings.</p></blockquote>

<p>I could not agree more. I studied pop culture and journalism in college after changing majors from marine biology my third year. I now have a very successful career in the STEM world, but I’ve never taken a computer science course. Heck, I’ve never even taken a typing course.</p>

<p>(I kinda regret that second one.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would be where I am today if I did not spend time in psychology, sociology, literature, drama, and anthropology classes. It’s not that a computer science course or two wouldn’t have helped me (it certainly would have), but broad exposure leads to broad perspectives and innovative thinking. It helps us see the interconnectedness of what surrounds us and helps us do our jobs better, no matter what our jobs are.</p>

<p>Fareed makes a lot of great points in this op-ed and you should definitely give it a read, but I will leave you with this important warning:</p>

<blockquote><p>Americans should be careful before they try to mimic Asian educational systems, which are oriented around memorization and test-taking. I went through that kind of system. It has its strengths, but it’s not conducive to thinking, problem solving or creativity. That’s why most Asian countries, from Singapore to South Korea to India, are trying to add features of a liberal education to their systems.</p></blockquote>

				<updated>2015-04-02T10:14:40-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/how-to-apply-progressive-enhancement-when-javascript-seems-like-a-requirement</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Stack Overflow last week, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4719194/jamham">JamHam</a> asked how to apply progressive enhancement in interfaces that seem to require JavaScript. Unfortunately he deleted the question before I could post my response, so I thought I would post it all here for posterity.</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to make my site (a content publishing &ldquo;web app&rdquo;) work fully without JavaScript, however, I&rsquo;ve found myself in situations where I can&rsquo;t honestly think how I would do some features without it.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a form submission page where you change certain settings, and the form changes accordingly.This is alright, I can apply query strings in the url and have some logic in my layout so that certain fields are shown/hidden according to the query string. The thing is, I also need to update a &ldquo;price&rdquo; dynamically, according to what fields are filled in, how they are filled in, and some other factors, and I don&rsquo;t honestly see how I could do that without JavaScript.</li>
<li>I have a messaging section where I&rsquo;m using WebSockets (with the help of Socket.io). The UI of the messaging (and of course, the
WebSockets) stuff pretty much depends on JavaScript, with &lsquo;messages&rsquo; being created as they arrive and appended into DOM and also a form that allows you to quickly look up an user via AJAX so you can send a message easily, among many other things.</li>
</ul>


<p>I mean, I could probably come up with very complicated solutions for each situation, and obviously the functionality wouldn&rsquo;t be the same. I&rsquo;m thinking I might as well just require JavaScript for the whole thing</p>

<p>But it kinda sucks, since I&rsquo;ve been making everything work without JavaScript, up until this point. And I would like some consistency across the whole site. In these kind of situations, is it acceptable to not support non-js clients? What would you suggest in this case?</p></blockquote>

<p>My response (which I was drafting when he deleted the question):</p>

<blockquote><p>First off, I applaud your interest in using progressive enhancement. It will ensure the most users possible have access to your content and will also result in a more robust application overall. As a general guiding principle, look to the past. How did we solve these issues before widespread JavaScript availability? Those &ldquo;Web 1.0&rdquo; solutions will still work and can be overtaken by supplanted by your JavaScript solution whenever it is possible to do so.</p>

<p>Every situation is different, but it is even possible to reuse a lot of code in both scenarios.</p>

<p>Now to address your interfaces…</p>

<p><strong>Your Submission Page</strong> &ndash; I could be wrong, but this sounds like a shopping cart to me (at least in essence). You are on the right track with query parameters, but you could also store info about the cart (and the user’s capabilities) in a session or cookie.</p>

<p>In terms of updating the &ldquo;cart&rdquo;, a simple &ldquo;update&rdquo; submit button that posts the form and triggers a redirection back to this page with the updated info would be sufficient. And if you need to show or hide fields based on choices made, you simply apply that logic on the server side. You could even have the server generate that same markup into the page, but hidden for situations where JavaScript is available.</p>

<p><strong>Your Messaging App</strong> &ndash; This can seem like a daunting challenge, but before we had web sockets and even Ajax, we relied on a small form which posts messages to the back end and a running feed of messages being sent from the back-end. One of the most common way to handle this involved frames and a &ldquo;meta refresh&rdquo; like this one:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That simple <code>meta</code> tag will make any browser refresh the page every 30 seconds. Now if you put that in an <code>iframe</code> to keep it from causing a refresh of the entire interface, any new messages would be picked up and displayed automatically at that interval (which you should tune to be appropriate for your app).</p>

<p>Once that is in place the page itself could even post to that frame by using the non-standard but well-supported <code>_target</code> attribute on the <code>form</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously with JavaScript enabled, you’d probably throw away that <code>iframe</code>, but the rest of the setup (including the templates for displaying the messages) could certainly be reused with WebSockets.</p></blockquote>

<p>I hope this helps. Progressive enhancement may seem like a huge challenge, but when you take a few moments to think about how we handled these challenges in the past, the way forward becomes clear.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Playing With Flexbox and Quantity Queries]]></title>
				<link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/playing-with-flexbox-and-quantity-queries/"/>
				<updated>2015-03-26T14:44:24-04:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/playing-with-flexbox-and-quantity-queries</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since reading <a href="http://twitter.com/heydonworks">Haydon Pickering</a>’s <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/quantity-queries-for-css">piece on quantity queries</a>, I’ve been musing over the possibilities for layout. I decided I to play around with them a bit on this site as it’s been a while since I’ve tweaked the design. Being that I wanted to experiment, I thought this would be a fun time to tuck into <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">Flexbox</a> a bit more as well.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here’s a brief overview of the project:</p>

<p><strong>The Candidate</strong>: My <a href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/speaking-engagements/">speaking engagements</a> page.<br>
<strong>The Challenge</strong>: The &ldquo;Future&rdquo; list will grow and shrink as I book things, so I never know how many will be there. The &ldquo;Past&rdquo; list will also grow, but I am less interested in getting crazy with that.<br>
<strong>The Idea</strong>: A grid layout that flexes to visually highlight 1-2 upcoming future events and allows the others to flow in at the default grid size. It should be set up to handle everything from a single future event to a dozen or more.</p>

<figure id="2015-03-26-1" class="media-container">
    <img src="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-03-26/the-idea-sm.jpg"
         srcset="/i/posts/2015-03-26/the-idea-lg.jpg 1024w, /i/posts/2015-03-26/the-idea-md.jpg 600w, /i/posts/2015-03-26/the-idea-sm.jpg 320w"
         alt="">
    <figcaption>
        <p>My sketch of the idea.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The markup pattern was pretty simple. It’s just a list of events:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/597284affc88b9084cf3.js?file=markup.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;ul class=&quot;listing listing--events&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;listing__item listing__item--1 event event--future&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- content --&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;!-- lis continue --&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>With that in place, I got to work.</p>

<h2>Single File</h2>

<p>To set the stage, I started with some basic Flexbox syntax<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by handling the container and the basic full-width small screen view:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/597284affc88b9084cf3.js?file=first-pass.css'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>.listing--events {
  display: flex;
}

.event {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1.25rem; /* 20px padding */
  margin: 0 0 1.25rem 0; /* 20px bottom margin */
  flex: 0 0 100%;
}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>You may be wondering where all of the experimental style rules are. I use <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> to handle the experimental property inclusion/trans-compilation so I can keep my CSS clean and standards-based.</p>

<p>This simple CSS gives you exactly what you’d expect: a vertical list of events, separated by 20px worth of space.</p>

<figure id="2015-03-26-2" class="media-container">
    <img src="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-03-26/first-pass.jpg"

         alt="">
</figure>


<h2>Two by Two</h2>

<p>Next up, I tackled the first breakpoint at 28.75em:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/597284affc88b9084cf3.js?file=second-pass.css'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>.listing--events {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: stretch;
}

.event {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1.25rem; /* 20px */
  margin: 0 0 1.25rem 0; /* 20px v */
  flex: 0 0 100%;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 28.75em) {
  
  /* 20px gap divided by 2 events per row */
  .event {
    flex: 0 0 calc( 50% - 1.25rem / 2 );
    margin-left: 1.25rem; /* 20px &lt; */
  }
  
  /* Remove left margin for row starters */
  .event:nth-child(odd) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
  /* Reset margins on &quot;future&quot; events
     &amp; remove the correct one */
  .event--future:nth-child(odd) {
    margin-left: 1.25rem;
  }
  .event--future:nth-child(even) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
  /* Quantity Query - when more than 1,
     make the first span both columns  */
  .event--future:nth-last-child(n+1):first-child {
    flex: 0 0 100%;
    font-size: 1.5em;
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>In this pass, I set up the event blocks to fill 50% of the parent container (well, 50% minus the 1.25rem gutter between them, using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#calc"><code>calc()</code></a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> In order to make the children wrap to form rows, I set <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code> on the list (<code>.listing--events</code>). Then, to make the children all equal heights across each row, I set <code>align-items: stretch</code>. The gutter space was achieved via left margins on all events save the row starters (<code>.event:nth-child(odd)</code>).</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that in the full page I have two sets of event listings: one past and one future. The &ldquo;event&rdquo; <code>class</code> is used in all instances. The modified &ldquo;future&rdquo; <code>class</code> is added to events that have not happened yet.</p>

<p>Then I used a quantity query to select the first future event when there is more than one in the list (line 38) and set it span 100% of the parent width. To keep the gutters accurate, I also swapped where the margins were applied, adding the margin back to <code>.event--future:nth-child(odd)</code> and removing it from <code>.event--future:nth-child(even)</code>.</p>

<figure id="2015-03-26-3" class="media-container">

         alt="">
</figure>


<h2>Three’s a Crowd</h2>

<p>Finally, I could tackle the third and most complicated layout. Things seemed to get a little wide around 690px, so I set the breakpoint to 43.125em.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/597284affc88b9084cf3.js?file=third-pass.css'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>.listing--events {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: stretch;
}

.event {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1.25rem; /* 20px */
  margin: 0 0 1.25rem 0; /* 20px v */
  flex: 0 0 100%;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 28.75em) {
  
  /* 20px gap divided by 2 events per row */
  .event {
    flex: 0 0 calc( 50% - 1.25rem / 2 );
    margin-left: 1.25rem; /* 20px &lt; */
  }
  
  /* Remove left margin for row starters */
  .event:nth-child(odd) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
  /* Reset margins on &quot;future&quot; events
     &amp; remove the correct one */
  .event--future:nth-child(odd) {
    margin-left: 1.25rem;
  }
  .event--future:nth-child(even) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
  /* Quantity Query - when more than 1,
     make the first span both columns  */
  .event--future:nth-last-child(n+1):first-child {
    flex: 0 0 100%;
    font-size: 1.5em;
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 43.125em) {

  /* 1/3 width with 20px gutter */
  .event {
    flex: 0 0 calc( 100% / 3 - .875rem );
  }

  /* Reset margins */
  .event:nth-child(even),
  .event:nth-child(odd) {
    margin-left: 1.25rem;
  }
  /* Normal Grid margin removal */
  .event:nth-child(3n+1) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
  /* Correct margins for the future events */
  .event--future:nth-child(3n+1) {
    margin-left: 1.25rem;
  }
  
  /* Quantity Query - when more than 2,
     make the first 2 go 50%  */
  .event--future:nth-last-child(n+2):first-child, 
  .event--future:nth-last-child(n+2):first-child + .event--future {
    flex: 0 0 calc( 50% - 1.25rem / 2 );
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
  
  /* Quantity + nth for margin removal */
  .event--future:nth-last-child(n+2):first-child ~ .event--future:nth-child(3n) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>In this final pass, I used a slightly more complicated calculation to set the width of each child to 1/3 of the parent minus the gutters between them (100% / 3 &ndash; 0.875rem).</p>

<p>If you’re paying close attention, you might wonder why the gutter being used in the calculation is 0.875rem rather than the full 1.25rem. Well, the reason is (as best I can surmise) rounding. In order to get the flex width to fill the parent without causing a wrap, 14px (0.875rem) seemed to be the magic number.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that if I allowed the event to grow (using <code>flex-grow: 1</code> or its equivalent in the shorthand), the column would fill in perfectly, but the last row would always be filled completely too. You could end up with two events in the last row being 50% wide each or a single event being 100% wide, which I didn’t want. I wanted them all to be equal width with the exception of the first 2. Setting <code>flex</code> as I did allowed that to happen.</p>

<p>I went ahead and reset the standard margins for events as well (on both <code>.event:nth-child(even)</code> and <code>.event:nth-child(odd)</code>). And then I turned off the margins on the first of every group of three events using <code>.event:nth-child(3n+1)</code>.</p>

<p>With that in place, I went to work on the future events, resetting the margins there as well. Then I used a quantity query (lines 70-71) to select the first two members when the list is more than 2 and set them to be 50% of the parent width minus the gutter.</p>

<p>To handle the margins in the quantity query instance, I added all the margins back (line 64) and then removed the left margins from the new row starters (line 77).</p>

<h2>Ta-da!</h2>

<p>And there you have it. In about 80 lines of very generously spaced and commented CSS, we’ve got a flexible grid-based Flexbox layout with visual enhancements injected via quantity queries. I’m sure I’ll continue to tinker, but I’m pretty happy with the results so far.</p>

<blockquote><p>My name is not only a common Indian name, but one of the top 1,000 names in the United States as well. But the final letter has still not been given its own Unicode character, so I have to use a substitute.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow. Just, wow.</p>

<p>Worried about Unicode getting too big?</p>

<blockquote><p>[O]ne might appeal to the limited space in the Unicode character set. Even if we take for granted the somewhat arbitrary maximum of 1,114,112 codepoints, the other alphabets included speak for themselves. The most recent update to the Unicode standard included the entire alphabet of Linear B, an ancient Mycenaean script that was not deciphered in the modern era until the 1950s.
