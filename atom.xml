				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/social-class-power-and-selfishness/"/>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this fascinating paper, David Dubois, Derek Rucker, and Adam Galinsky explore the interplay between socioeconomic status and selfishness (or cheating). In the course of their study, they discovered that people at both ends of the spectrum cheat, but for different ends:</p>

<blockquote><p>[S]ocial class positively predicted unethical behavior; however, this relationship was only observed when that behavior was self-beneficial. When unethical behavior was performed to benefit others, social class negatively predicted unethical behavior; lower class individuals were more likely than upper class individuals to engage in unethical behavior. Overall, social class predicts people’s tendency to behave selfishly, rather than predicting unethical behavior per se.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second thing they discovered was that the cause of selfishness came from an individuals’ sense of power:</p>

<blockquote><p>Evidence for this relationship was provided in three forms. First, income, but not education level, predicted unethical behavior. Second, feelings of power mediated the effect of social class on unethical behavior, but feelings of status did not. Third, two distinct manipulations of power produced the same moderation by self-versus-other beneficiary as was found with social class.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fascinating stuff!</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[The “Web Application” Myth]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/the-web-application-myth/"/>
				<updated>2015-02-10T19:39:53-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/the-web-application-myth</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christian Heilmann is dead-on in this post. It’s a long one, but worth reading. Here’s my favorite bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What is an application?</em> To me, it is a tool that allows people to reach a certain goal in the most effective fashion. What matters is not what language or technology you build it in. What matters most is:</p>
<ul>
<li>that it is the right tool for the right audience,</li>
<li>that it does what is expected of it and not more,</li>
<li>that it is safe to use,</li>
<li>that it works in the environment it is most used in,</li>
<li>that it can be easily maintained without dependencies that only a few people know how to use,</li>
<li>that it is built with components that are reliable to use and not a “alpha” or “beta” or “not production ready” experimental technology</li>
<li>that we know how to maintain the thing, how to add new functionality and above all, fix security issues in the future without replacing it as a whole.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the things we should concentrate on. To find the answer as to what format this “application” will be, we need a mixture of skills of people working on the product:</p>

<ul>
<li>researchers,</li>
<li>designers,</li>
<li>UX people,</li>
<li>content writers,</li>
<li>trainers to show people how to use the tool and how to put content in it afterwards and,</li>
<li>yes, of course, developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is the scary part: <strong>this costs money and a lot of effort</strong>. It also means that we have to think about communicating and building teams that are good at bouncing ideas off one another and find a good consensus. It also means it will take longer to build this.</p>

<p>All of this is <em>anathema</em> to people who have to show off to venture capital companies and stakeholders. We have to move faster, we have to be better. Less people, more products, quicker iterations, more features. It doesn’t matter what the product does: the most important part is that you show that it evolves and changes constantly.</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/designing-digital-technology-for-the-elderly/"/>
				<updated>2015-02-06T17:51:36-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/designing-digital-technology-for-the-elderly</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re all aging. There’s no way to avoid it, no matter how much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone">HGH</a> you consume. And as we age, our eyesight typically worsens, we lose some motor control, and our brains often don’t process data quite as fast as they did when we were 18 or even 30. As designers, we need to be cognizant of the needs of aging computer users.</p>

<p>Ollie Campbell has put together a great read on creating digital products that accommodate the aging population (estimated to top 19% of the US population by 2030). In it, he discusses things we should consider with respect to</p>

<ul>
<li>vision and hearing,</li>
<li>motor control,</li>
<li>device use,</li>
<li>relationships,</li>
<li>life stage,</li>
<li>experience with technology,</li>
<li>cognition,</li>
<li>memory,</li>
<li>attention, and</li>
<li>decision-making.</li>
</ul>


<p>It’s pretty exhaustive. You should definitely give it a read.</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web/"/>
				<updated>2015-02-05T21:05:36-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/reframing-accessibility-for-the-web</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lots of great stuff here from Anne Gibson:</p>

<blockquote><p>We need to change the way we talk about accessibility. Most people are taught that “web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web”—the official definition from the W3C. This is wrong. Web accessibility means that people can use the web.</p>

<p>Not “people with disabilities.” Not “blind people and deaf people.” Not “people who have cognitive disabilities” or “men who are color blind” or “people with motor disabilities.” People. People who are using the web. People who are using what you’re building.</p>

<p>We need to stop invoking the internal stereotypes we have about who is disabled.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anne goes on to offer a lot of practical and helpful advice around how to change the way you think about accessibility and how to act upon that change. You should definitely read it.</p>

				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/youre-missing-the-point-of-server-side-rendered-javascript-apps</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I agree with Tom Dale. Yup, you read that right: I agree with Tom Dale. Well, he finally said something sensible:</p>

<blockquote><p>Say what you will about server-rendered apps, the performance of your server is much more predictable, and more easily upgraded, than the many, many different device configurations of your users. Server-rendering is important to ensure that users who are not on the latest-and-greatest can see your content immediately when they click a link.</p></blockquote>

<p>You might remember Tom as the guy who <a href="http://tomdale.net/2013/09/progressive-enhancement-is-dead/">declared progressive enhancement dead in late 2013</a>. He’s apparently seen the light and has been hard at work to get Ember ready for server side rendering.</p>

<p>I’m shocked, but glad he finally came around. Progressive enhancement FTW!</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Now in 2015 we have web components re-inventing native HTML buttons, radio buttons and checkboxes, for relief from the scourge of divitis, perpetrated upon us by the as shipped inability to style a native HTML element as desired.</p>

<p>Now, the <a href="http://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/">Shadow DOM</a> (and <a href="https://gist.github.com/webtobesocial/aefd6e25064c08e0cc9a">associated pseudo-elements</a>) should allow us to control the style of these elements. The deeper problem is functionality. Take <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-datalist-element">the <code>datalist</code> for predictive typing</a>. What if you want fuzzy search instead of initial search when someone types. That’s not supported. This is where Web Components get interesting.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monday, February 2nd will be the start of a new chapter in my professional career: I will joining Microsoft as a standards evangelist.</p>

<p><em>Wha?!</em></p>

<p>The reasons for the move are manifold, but I will do my best to summarize by taking you on the journey I’ve been on and hopefully that will help you understand why I will be leaving agency life behind and joining a browser maker (and the makers of Internet Explorer at that).</p>

<!-- more -->




<hr>


<p>I’ve been working on the Web since 1996. That’s nearly 20 years of building everything from simple marketing campaign sites to emails to complex transactional websites and custom content management systems. In that time, I’ve gained skills on both the front end and the back end and rolled the 10,000 hour odometer at least a couple of times.</p>

<p>It’s been great. I love building things and I love helping our amazing clients put awesome information and services on the Web. But at the same time, I’ve enjoyed working with teams to help <em>them</em> solve their own problems even more than I’ve enjoyed solving them directly. It’s why I love speaking at conferences and running workshops: I love to see the lightbulbs come on over people’s heads!</p>

<p>Over the last few years, <a href="http://easy-designs.net">Kelly and I</a> have made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of production work we’ve been doing in favor of more consulting. And early last year we came to a sort of crossroads: We knew we could keep doing what we’d been doing and things would be good, but we weren’t feeling challenged anymore.</p>

<p>And so we began to brainstorm ideas of what we’d like to do in the next phase of our lives.</p>

<hr>


<p>Kelly came to the Web from an education and community organizing background, so she wanted to find a way to incorporate those with her technical knowledge. And about two months ago, she got that opportunity and she took a position as the Program Manager for <a href="http://techgoeshomecha.org/">Tech Goes Home Chattanooga</a>, an organization committed to bridging the digital divide in our fair city.</p>

<p>When I close my eyes and think about what makes me happiest, it’s writing, speaking, and spreading the word about web design best practices. The folks I know who get to do that full-time tend to be developer evangelists (or <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a>). And so I began pondering that possibility.</p>

<p>As I went through the list of browser makers in my mind, Microsoft stuck out.</p>

<p>Some of you might think that’s odd. I mean come on, IE has been the red-headed stepchild of the web design world for the better part of a decade. Why on earth would I want to work there?</p>

<p>Well, I’ll tell you: Despite its market largesse, IE (and in many ways Microsoft) is operating like the scrappy upstart. And I root for underdogs.</p>

<hr>


<p>I think back to the early days of the Web when I would need a Windows license for every virtual machine I wanted to run in order to test each browser version. It was a pain in the ass and made me curse Microsoft on a regular basis.</p>

<p>But things have changed. A lot.</p>

<p>A few years back, the IE team launched <a href="http://modern.ie">modern.IE</a>, an awesome resource with VMs that were free for the taking. They also launched <a href="https://www.modern.ie/en-us/report">a free tool for identifying coding issues and checking cross-browser interoperability</a>. Then they opened up <a href="http://status.modern.ie">the roadmap for standards implementations in IE</a>. And just recently they gave us <a href="https://remote.modern.ie/">RemoteIE</a> and did away with the need for VMs altogether (at least to test our stuff on the latest version of IE).</p>

<p>This is a very different Microsoft.</p>

<p>Now sure, there’s still more they could open up, but this is progress. Big ships are slow to turn, but this ship is turning.</p>

<p>I want to be a part of that.</p>

<hr>


<p>I will be joining Microsoft as a “Senior Program Manager”, but titles don’t matter much to me. I see my job boiling down to a few key things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Helping web designers and developers better understand the possibilities of the Web;</li>
<li>Advocating for interoperable, accessible web design best practices;</li>
<li>Being a voice for the web design and development community to communicate their needs to the IE team in order to improve the browser; and</li>
<li>Being an internal advocate for Web standards implementations in other Microsoft products (think Visual Studio, Outlook, Word).</li>
</ol>


<p>Microsoft is not hiring me to be a salesman—<em>thank god, they’d be pretty disappointed</em>—they are hiring me to continue being me. I will continue writing, I will continue speaking, and I will continue educating. The only thing that has changed is that I can spend all of my time doing that, rather than having to balance it with client work.</p>

<hr>


<p>So Monday starts a new chapter in my career. It’s a little scary (I haven’t worked for someone else for over a decade), but it is also exciting. I am comforted by the fact that I am joining an amazing team: As he announced yesterday, <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2015/01/29/on-towards-my-next-challenge-2/">Christian Heilmann will also join Microsoft on the 2nd</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAIPCp_BOGU">charismatic Rey Bango</a> will be leading our merry little conga line.</p>

<p>I’m excited about the future and I’m thrilled to be given the opportunity to focus on making the Web better… for everyone.</p>

<blockquote><p>More and more so, the programming we once watched on TV is migrating to our tablets and phones.

Comcast et al realize they must let you access that content where your eyeballs are, or you’ll find other content. Ditto Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony. Game consoles cannot be married to the TV.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is Microsoft’s Jacob Rossi on how “Project Spartan” came to be and what is going on inside the browser that comes after Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>On that elated feeling of removing legacy code:</p>

<blockquote><p>[S]wathes of IE legacy were deleted from the new engine. Gone were document modes. Removed was the subsystem responsible for emulating IE8 layout quirks. VBScript eliminated. Remnants like attachEvent, X-UA-Compatible, currentStyle were all purged from the new engine. The codebase looks little like Trident anymore (far more diverged already than even Blink is from WebKit).</p></blockquote>

<p>On a faster dev cycle for the new browser:</p>

<blockquote><p>[W]e’ll treat Windows 10 as a service—keeping users up to date and delivering features when they are ready (“auto-update”), not waiting for the next major release. This means the new rendering engine will always be truly evergreen.</p></blockquote>

<p>On opening up the process:</p>

<blockquote><p>Another welcomed change that we’ve been rolling out over the past year is a promise for increased openness about our web platform plans and roadmap. Over the last year, you’ve hopefully experienced some of this through our open standards roadmap15 (one of my personal side projects), our Reddit AMA16, regular dialog through @IEDevChat17, and sharing preview builds18 very early in our development process. You’ll see more of this over the next year.</p></blockquote>

<p>Promising stuff all around. I am still wondering if we’ll eventually see the new browser appear on other operating systems (even if it’s  just the browser chrome and not the rendering engine—like Chrome on iOS). Time will tell.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his continuing exploration of font loading optimization, Zach Leatherman proposes loading a Roman (i.e. normal weight, non-italic) font first and letting the browser synthesize (i.e. fake) the bold, italic, etc. variants to reduce the load time and reflow of the document and let users start reading as soon as possible. Then he lazy loads the additional font weights and styles so the browser can swap out the synthesized glyphs for the actual ones.</p>

<p>Super clever stuff Zach!</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another awesome post from Adrian Roselli on the perils of pushing for a one-browser (a.k.a. WebKit) world:</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone who calls for WebKit in Internet Explorer is exactly the same kind of developer who would have coded to Internet Explorer 15 years ago (and probably happily displayed the best viewed in badge).</p>

<p>If you are that developer, then it will all be your fault when it happens again. When WebKit is no longer the hot engine. When Chrome loses its dominance. When Apple&rsquo;s market share falls to match the developing world. You will be to blame.</p>

<p>Do you think that won&rsquo;t happen? Just look to Android browser fragmentation, or WebKit failing to support a standard that Firefox and IE have nailed, or Chrome introducing its own proprietary features (can&rsquo;t find the link; it&rsquo;s coming), or failing to use best practices as it tries to carry the next big thing forward, or the complete lack of developer relations from Apple. We&rsquo;ve had over half a decade of warning signs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s happening again, and every petulant, lazy developer who calls for a WebKit-only world is responsible.</p></blockquote>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And here we have yet another new browser. Vivaldi is inspired by the Opera of old and is pretty feature-rich according to the article. I’ll give it a shot.</p>

<p>Vivaldi runs Blink under the hood (like Opera and Chrome), which lends credence to my theory that <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/competing-on-chrome/">soon browsers will compete on chrome, rather than standards implementations</a>.</p>
