			<p>Yesterday at <a href="//2014.blendconf.com/">BlendConf</a>, <a href="//www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> gave a fantastically-entertaining keynote entitled “JavaScript, The Cloud, and the rise of the New Virtual Machine.” In it, he chronicled all of the ways Web development and deployment has changed—for the better—over the years. He also boldly declared that JavaScript is now, effectively, a virtual machine in the browser.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is a topic that has been weighing on my mind for quite some time now. I’ll start by saying that I’m a big fan of JavaScript. I write a lot of it and I find it incredibly useful, both as a programming language and as a way to improve the usability and accessibility of content on the Web. That said, I know its limitations. But I’ll get to that in a minute.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Web, “proper” software developers shied away from JavaScript. Many viewed it as a “toy” language (and felt similarly about HTML and CSS). It wasn’t as powerful as Java or Perl or C in their minds, so it wasn’t really worth learning. In the intervening years, however, JavaScript has changed a lot.</p>

<p>Most of these developers first began taking JavaScript seriously in the mid ’00s when Ajax became popular. And with the rise of JavaScript MVC frameworks and their ilk—Angular, Ember, etc.—many of these developers made their way onto the Web. I would argue that this, overall, is a good thing: We need more people working on the Web to make it better.</p>

<p>The one problem I’ve seen, however, is the fundamental disconnect many of these developers seem to have with the way deploying code on the Web works. In traditional software development, we have some say in the execution environment. On the Web, we don’t.</p>

<p>I’ll explain.</p>

<p>If we’re writing server-side software in Python or Rails or even PHP, one of two things is true:</p>

<ol>
<li>We control the server environment: operating system, language versions, packages, etc.; or</li>
<li>We don’t control the server environment, but we have knowledge of it and can author your program accordingly so it will execute as anticipated.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the more traditional installed software world, we can similarly control the environment by placing certain restrictions on what operating systems our code can run on and what the dependencies for its use may be in terms of hard drive space and RAM required. We provide that information up front and users can choose to use our software or use a competing product based on what will work for them.</p>

<p>On the Web, however, all bets are off. The Web is ubiquitous. The Web is messy. And, as much as we might like to control a user’s experience down to the very pixel, those of us who have been working on the Web for a while understand that it’s a fool’s errand and <a href="//dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">have adjusted our expectations accordingly</a>. Unfortunately, this new crop of Web developers doesn’t seem to have gotten that memo.</p>

<p>We do not control the environment executing our JavaScript code, interpreting our HTML, or applying our CSS. Our users control the device (and, thereby, its processor speed, RAM, etc.). Our users choose the operating system. Our users pick the browser and which version they use. Our users can decide which add-ons they put in the browser. Our users can shrink or enlarge the fonts used to display our Web pages and apps. And the Internet providers that sit between us and our users, dictating the network speed, latency, and ultimately <a href="//aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/2014/the-network-effect/">controlling how—and what part of—our content makes it to our users</a>.</p>

<p>All we can do is author a compelling, adaptive experience, cross our fingers, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with viewing JavaScript as the new VM is that it creates the illusion of control. Sure, if we are building an internal Web app, we might be able to dictate the OS/browser combination for all of our users and lock down their machines to prevent them from modifying those settings, but that’s not the reality on the open Web.</p>

<p>The fact is that we can’t absolutely rely on the availability of any specific technology when it comes to delivering a Web experience. Instead, we must look at <em>how</em> we construct that experience and make smarter decisions about how we use specific technologies in order to take advantage of their benefits while simultaneously understanding that their availability is not guaranteed. This is why progressive enhancement is such a useful philosophy.</p>

<p>The history of the Web is littered with JavaScript disaster stories. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use JavaScript or that it’s inherently bad. It simply means we need to be smarter about our approach to JavaScript and build robust experiences that allow users to do what they need to do quickly and easily even if our carefully-crafted, incredibly well-designed JavaScript-driven interface won’t run.</p>

			After I took issue with some thoughts of Aaron Gustafson regarding JavaScript, Aaron has clarified his thoughts elegantly.
His key issue here is summed up by one sentence from his post: “The fact is that you can’t build a robust Web experience that relies solely on client-side JavaScript.” Now, I could nit-pick various details about the argument he provides (I’ve had as many buggy modules from npm or PyPI as I’ve had from the Google jQuery CDN, and if you specify exact version numbers that’s less of a problem; writing software specifically for one client might allow you to run a carbon copy of their server, but server software for wide distribution, especially open source, doesn’t and shouldn’t have that luxury) but those sorts of pettifogging nit-picks are, I hope, beneath us. In short, I’ll say this: I agree with Aaron. He is right. However, this discussion uncovers some wider issues.
Now, I’ve built pure client-side apps. The WebUtils are a suite of small apps which one would expect to find on a particular platform (a calculator, a compass, a currency converter, that sort of thing), but built to be pure web apps in order that someone deciding to use the web as their platform has access to these things. (If you’re interested in this idea, get involved in the project.) I built two of them; a calculator and a currency converter. Both are pure-client-side, JavaScript-requiring, Angular-using apps. I am, in general and in total agreement with Aaron, opposed to the idea that without JavaScript a web app doesn’t work. (And here by “without JavaScript” we must also include being with JavaScript but JavaScript which gets screwed up by your mobile carrier injecting extra scripts, or your ISP blocking CDNs, or your social media buttons throwing errors, or your ads stomping on your variables. All of these are real problems which go unacknowledged and Aaron is entirely right to bring them up.) However, the policy that apps should be robust to JS not working, by being server apps which are progressively enhanced, does ignore an elephant in the room.
It is this. I should not need an internet connection in order to make my calculator add 4 and 5.
A web app which does not require its client-side scripting, which works on the server and then is progressively enhanced, does not work in an offline environment. It doesn’t work when you’re in and out of train tunnels, or at a conference with bad wifi, or on a metered data connection. The offline first concept, which should be informing how we build apps, is right about this.
So, what to do? It is in theory possible to write a web app which does processing on the server and is entirely robust against its client-side scripting being broken or missing, and which does processing on the client so that it works when the server’s unavailable or uncontactable or expensive or slow. But let’s be honest here. That’s not an app. That’s two apps. They might share a bit of code (the server being node.js and using JavaScript might help here, but that’s not what I was talking about last time), but in practice you’re building the same app twice in two different environments and then delivering both through one URL.
This is a problem. I am not sure how to square this circle. Aaron is right that you can’t build a robust Web experience that relies solely on client-side JavaScript, but the word robust is doing an awful lot of work in that sentence. In particular, it means “you can’t build a thing which you can be sure will work for everybody”. Most of the time, for most of the people, your experience can be robust — fine, it’ll break if your ad JavaScript sods you up, or if your ISP blocks your jQuery download, and these are problems. But going the other direction — explicitly not relying on your client-side JS — means that you’ll be robust until you’re somewhere without a good internet connection. Both of these approaches end up breaking in certain situations. And making something which handles both these camps is a serious amount of work, and we don’t really know how to do it. (I’d be interested in hearing examples of a web app which will work if I run it in an environment with a flaky internet connection and having redefined window.Array to be something else on the client. I bet there isn’t one.)
This needs to be a larger conversation. It needs discussion from both JavaScript people and server people. These two camps should not be separate, not be balkanised; there is an attitude still among “real programmers” that JavaScript is not a real language. Now, I will be abundantly clear here: Aaron is not one of the people who thinks this. But I worry that perpetuating the idea that JavaScript is an unstable environment will cause JS people to wall themselves off and stop listening to reasoned debate, which won’t help. As I say, I don’t know how to square this circle. The Web is an environment unlike any other, and as Aaron says, “building the Web requires more of us than traditional software development”. We get huge benefits from doing so — you build for the Web, and do it right, and your thing is available to everybody everywhere — but to “do it right” is a pretty big task, and it gets bigger every day. We need to be talking about that more so we can work out how to do it.

			Fundamentally connected
		
		
			Aaron Gustafson recently wrote a very interesting monograph bemoaning a recent trend to view JavaScript as “a virtual machine in the browser”. I’ll quote fairly extensively, because Aaron makes some really strong points here, and I have a lot of sympathy with them. But at bottom I think he’s wrong, or at the very least he’s looking at this question from the wrong direction, like trying to divine the purpose of the Taj Mahal by looking at it from underneath.
“The one problem I’ve seen,” says Aaron, “is the fundamental disconnect many of these developers [who began taking JavaScript seriously after Ajax became popular] seem to have with the way deploying code on the Web works. In traditional software development, we have some say in the execution environment. On the Web, we don’t.” He goes on to explain: “If we’re writing server-side software in Python or Rails or even PHP, … we control the server environment [or] we have knowledge of it and can author… accordingly”, and “in the more traditional installed software world, we can similarly control the environment by placing certain restrictions on what operating systems our code can run on”.
I believe that this criticism, while essentially valid, misapprehends the real case here. It underestimates the universality of JavaScript implementations, it overestimates the stability of old-fashioned software development, and most importantly it starts from the presumption that building things for one particular computer is actually a good idea. Which it isn’t.
Now, nobody is arguing that the web environment is occasionally challengingly different across browsers and devices. But a lot of it isn’t. No browser ships with a JavaScript implementation in which 1 and 1 add to make 3, or in which Arrays don’t have a length property, or in which the for keyword doesn’t exist. If we ignore some of the Mozilla-specific stuff which is becoming ES6 (things such as array comprehensions, which nobody is actually using in actual live code out there in the universe), JavaScript is pretty stable and pretty unchanging across all its implementations. Of course, what we’re really talking about here is the DOM model, not JavaScript-the-language, and to claim that “JavaScript can be the virtual machine” and then say “aha I didn’t mean the DOM” is sophistry on a par with a child asking “can I not not not not not have an ice-cream?”. But the DOM model is pretty stable too, let’s be honest. In things I build, certainly I find myself in murky depths occasionally with JavaScript across different browsers and devices, but those depths are as the sparkling waters of Lake Treviso by comparison with CSS across different browsers. In fact, when CSS proves problematic across browsers, JavaScript is the bandage used to fix it and provide a consistent experience — your keyframed CSS animation might be unreliable, but jQuery plugins work everywhere. JavaScript is the glue that binds the other bits together.
Equally, I am not at all sold that “we have knowledge of [the server environment] and can author your program accordingly so it will execute as anticipated” when doing server development. Or, at least, that’s possible, but nobody does. If you doubt this, I invite you to go file a bug on any server-side app you like and say “this thing doesn’t work right for me” and then add at the bottom “oh, and I’m running FreeBSD, not Ubuntu”. The response will occasionally be “oh really? we had better get that fixed then!” but is much more likely to be “we don’t support that. Use Ubuntu and this git repository.” Now, that’s a valid approach — we only support this specific known configuration! — but importantly, on the web Aaron sees requiring a specific browser/OS combination as an impractical impossibility and the wrong thing to do, whereas doing this on the server is positively virtuous. I believe that this is no virtue. Dismissing claims of failure with “well, you should be using the environment I demand” is just as large a sin on the server or the desktop as it is in the browser. You, the web developer, can’t require that I use your choice of browser, but equally you, the server developer, shouldn’t require that I use your particular exact combination of server packages either. Why do client users deserve more respect than server users? If a developer using your server software should be compelled to go and get a different server, how’s that different from asking someone to install a different web browser? Sure, I’m not expecting someone who built a server app running on Linux to necessarily also make it run on Windows (although wise developers will do so), but then I’m not really expecting someone who’s built a 3d game with WebGL to make the experience meaningful for someone browsing with Lynx, either.
Perhaps though you differ there, gentle reader. That the web is the web, and one should have a meaningful experience (although importantly not necessarily the same meaningful experience) which ever class of browser and device and capability one uses to get at the web. That is a very good point, one with which I have a reasonable amount of sympathy, and it leads me on to the final part of the argument. 
It is this. Web developers are actually better than non-web developers. And Aaron explains precisely why. It is because to build a great web app is precisely to build a thing which can be meaningfully experienced by people on any class of browser and device and capability. The absolute tip-top very best “native” app can only be enjoyed by those to whom it is native. “Native apps” are poetry: undeniably beautiful when done well, but useless if you don’t speak the language. A great web app, on the other hand, is a painting: beautiful to experience and available to everybody. The Web has trained its developers to attempt to build something that is fundamentally egalitarian, fundamentally available to everyone. That’s why the Web’s good. The old software model, of something which only works in one place, isn’t the baseline against which the Web should be judged; it’s something that’s been surpassed. Software development is easiest if it only has to work on your own machine, but that doesn’t mean that that’s all we should aim for. We’re all still collaboratively working out exactly how to build apps this way. Do we always succeed? No. But by any measure the Web is the largest, most widely deployed, most popular and most ubiquitous computing platform the world has ever known. And its programming language is JavaScript.
