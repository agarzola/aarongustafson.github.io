<p>Anyway <a href="http://aka.ms/ktlsyd">//build/</a>, the Microsoft conference, is going on right now and as you’d expect, there are a ton of new announcements. I’ve watched a few of the talks virtualy and am particularly excited about the new browser (whose name has finally been revealed): <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/browser-for-doing">Microsoft Edge</a>. I’m also very interested to see where things go with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">HoloLens</a>.</p>

<p>One graphic that cropped up that blew my mind was this one talking about where Windows 10 is going:</p>

<p><figure id="fig-2015-04-30-01" class="media-container"></figure></p>

<p>You’ve often heard me discuss <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/chapter-1.html">experience as a continuum</a>. Microsoft is living it.</p>

<p>If you didn’t watch the streaming talks and want to hear about what was announced from some independent sources, I’d recommend reading these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/microsoft-build-hololens/">Microsoft Shows HoloLens’ Augmented Reality Is No Gimmick</a> — <cite>Wired</cite>
A good overview of the possibilities of HoloLens with a recap of what was shown. I caught this demo on the lifestream. It was pretty impressive. I can’t wait to try a HoloLens myself.</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/04/30/microsoft-opens-up-applications-for-developers-to-test-ios-and-android-app-conversion-tools/">Microsoft opens up applications for developers to test iOS and Android app conversion tools</a> — <cite>The Next Web</cite>
The Microsoft App Store is a little scant on first-rate programs right now, so in a play to make it stupid-simple for iOS and Android developers to run on Windows 10, the folks at Microsoft have built a conversion tool that ports the app for you. It’s worth noting that you can also port a website into a native Windows app. Smart move on Microsoft’s part if you ask me.</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/04/30/hands-on-with-the-new-minimalist-microsoft-edge-browser/">Hands-on: The new Microsoft Edge browser is a picture of minimalism</a> — <cite>The Next Web</cite>
Obviously the web is where I live and work. I’ve been playing with early builds of the new Microsoft browser for a few months now and have been pretty happy with its speed and capabilities, but it is nice to read an outside perspective on it.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>I will continue adding to this list as new &amp; interesting pieces come out</em>.</p>
