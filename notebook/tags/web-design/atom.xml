    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I see this one all the time: something that looks like a button, but only a portion of it is tappable. <!-- more -->Consider this example from a recent email I received (emails are notorious for this crap):</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-08-17-01" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/01.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/01.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>A call to action from a recent email with the tiny tappable area highlighted within the much larger "button".</figcaption></figure>

<p>This screenshot shows a very large call to action, which is good. Unfortunately, as the screenshot illustrates, the majority of the “button” is a table cell and the tappable link is just the text inside it.</p>

<p>The markup itself isn’t horrible; here’s a distillation of that row in the design:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/711cbd1054e8ee868a93.js?file=example.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;Shop Biotek Marine&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>The problem is that the 15px padding and overall button styles were put on the table cell rather than the link itself. Setting the link to have a <code>display</code> of “block” or “inline-block” would allow it to be given vertical padding (which is probably the issue the designer was struggling with here). Then the remainder of the styles could be migrated without adjusting the design at all.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-08-17-02" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/02.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/02.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-08-17/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>The same email with the padding shifted to the link, making more of the "button" tappable.</figcaption></figure>

<p>When you design something that looks interactive, <em>always make sure the whole thing is actually tappable</em>. It will go along way toward reducing user frustration.</p>

    <id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/ramblings-on-new-browser-features-interoperability-craft-and-the-future-of-the-web</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/about/">Peter-Paul Koch (PPK)</a> posted <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/07/stop_pushing_th.html">a lengthy treatise on why browsers should stop “pushing the web forward”</a>. I thoroughly enjoyed the read and agree with him on a number of points. I also agreed with the well-articulated responses from <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2015/if-we-stand-still-we-go-backwards/">Jake Archibald (of Google)</a> and <a href="https://dev.opera.com/blog/on-a-moratorium-on-new-browser-features/">Bruce Lawson (of Opera)</a>. I guess I’m saying I see both sides. Like <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a>, I live in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-gray-gray-ghost-that-i-call-home/">a world filled with varying shades of grey</a> rather than stark black &amp; white.</p>

<h2 id="new-features-vs-interoperability">New Features vs. Interoperability</h2>

<p>One of the arguments PPK makes is against browsers competing on features. It really rang true to me: </p>

<blockquote>

I call for a moratorium on new browser features of about a year. Let’s postpone all completely new features that as of right now don’t yet work in any browser.

Browsers are encouraged to add features that are already supported by other browsers, and to write bug fixes. In fact, finding time for these unglorious but necessary jobs would be an important advantage of the moratorium. As an added bonus it would decrease the amount of tools web developers need.

</blockquote>

<p><a href="/notebook/competing-on-chrome/">Back in January</a>, I wrote about how I was excited by Microsoft’s announcement of “Project Spartan” (now “Microsoft Edge”) and it’s focus on interoperability. Interoperability’s a long word, so I’m gonna go with “interop” from here on out.</p>

<p>I was not on the Microsoft payroll at the time, but I was still stoked to see their focus on interop in the new rendering engine. They’d even gone, in my humble opinion, above and beyond in this regard—aliasing Webkit’s experimental, legacy CSS syntaxes to their modern, standards-based implementations. This ensured poorly coded sites worked well in their browser and didn’t penalize users for a designer’s mistake. Talk about being a good web citizen!</p>

<p>Of course, Microsoft Edge wasn’t the first browser to do this. <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/vendor-prefixes-competing">IE 7 Mobile implemented <code>-webkit-text-size-adjust</code> back in 2010</a>. <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/opera-mobile-emulator-webkit-prefix-support/">Opera</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Layout/CSS_Compatibility#questions_and_methodology">Mozilla</a> also <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0313.html">felt the pressure</a> and eventually implemented <code>-webkit-</code> vendors prefixes in versions of their browsers. It’s a weird world when one browser vendor is forced to implement another’s proprietary syntax just to make the web work, but it’s the sad state of things in our <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2015/07/17/the-full-stackoverflow-developer/">full StackOverflow development</a> world.</p>

<p>With the move away from vendor prefixes in CSS to <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/139736/how-to-change-hidden-advanced-settings-in-any-browser/">“feature flags”</a>, you’d think this sort of thing would be behind us, but it’s not. <a href="http://www.otsukare.info/">Karl Dubost</a>, of Mozilla, recently <a href="http://www.otsukare.info/2015/07/29/vendor-prefixes-market">bemoaned the implications of Apple’s latest vendor prefix silliness</a> on his blog. In that post, he made a keen observation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have reached the point where browser vendors have to start implementing or aliasing these WebKit prefixes just to allow their users to browse the Web, see <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Mobile/Non_Standard_Compatibility">Mozilla</a> in Gecko and <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobrossi/status/614544147941355520">Microsoft</a> in Edge. The same thing is happening over again. In the past, browser vendors had to implement the quirks of IE to be compatible with the Web. As much as I hate it, we will have to specify the current <code>-webkit-</code> prefixes to implement them uniformly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely understand PPK’s desire for browsers to apply the brakes a bit and focus on interop. With new features being added to “the web”—but in reality only browser X, Y, or Z—on the regular, without guaranteed interop, it feels like we’re stirring up the browser wars again. All the new shiny is exciting, but I lived through the browser wars the first time and they sucked for everyone involved. <span data-quotable="">Web standards helped us get everyone on the same page and brokered what we’d hoped was going to be a lasting peace.</span></p>

<p>Now I’m not sure I agree with applying the brakes for a specific amount of time, but I do see great value in prioritizing interop over new features. And when browsers do implement new features, they should definitely put them behind feature flags (or some similar opt-in) to ensure we—the web development community—don’t start relying on some fancy new feature before it’s been vetted. Feature flags are awesome because they allow me, a designer, to experiment with a new technology <em>in my own browser</em> without affecting things for everyone else on the open web.</p>

<p><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/prefix-or-posthack">We used to think vendor prefixes were enough of a deterrent</a> to using a particular experimental CSS property or JavaScript method. Sadly that’s turned out to not be the case. I would bet good money on the sad reality that 80% of the working web designers out there don’t understand that <code>-*-</code> means “experimental” or even “proprietary”. We—the web design authors, speakers, educators, and other influencers—did a shitty job landing that message with the industry as a whole. But even if we’d hounded people about it, it probably wouldn’t have mattered: Vendor-prefixed properties work. And now they work even in browsers they were never meant to.</p>

<p>So, here’s what I’d love to see browser vendors do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prioritize interop over new features. Don’t halt development on new features, just put them on the back burner so the rising tide can, as they say, lift <em>all</em> the ships. Web developers and end users all benefit when there’s feature parity and stability among browsers.</li>
  <li>Put a ban on vendor-prefixes. They are not generally understood to be experimental. If you feel you must use a vendor prefix, ensure it’s only enabled by a corresponding feature flag.</li>
  <li>Use feature flags (or some similar opt-in) to enable developers to test experimental features in their own browsers, but also to ensure they aren’t available on the “open web” before they’re ready.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-web-vs-native">The Web vs. Native</h2>

<p>PPK has harped on this a few times. There is currently a palpable tension between “native” and “the web”. It’s driving most of the new features in the web “platform”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and it’s giving many of us old-timers a touch of angina.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: The web was created as a massively interconnected document repository. A wealth of knowledge dependent on the hyperlink and the URL. The web was (and indeed still is) stateless by default, meaning it has no idea who you are or what you’ve done from request to request. This is very egalitarian: everyone has access and anyone can contribute.</p>

<p>As more businesses moved online, the web became necessarily transactional. Suddenly websites needed to know information about your “state” so they could sell you things and track your movements around their site and the rest of the web. With the advent of cookies and the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), a web server could adjust the content it sent in response to a request, based on what it knew about you and what you were doing. </p>

<p>Taking this simple capacity a step further, it became possible to write actual software on the web. Content management systems were probably the first big chunk of software to move online, but more soon followed. JavaScript came along and allowed us to add a bit of logic to the client side, reducing our reliance on round-trips to the server. Then we got Ajax and the whole JavaScript world exploded. We now have web-based photo editors, integrated development environments (IDEs), games, and more, all reliant on JavaScript’s ability to interact with the browser and manipulate what the user sees in real-time.</p>

<p>There were earlier machinations certainly, but the last ten years have seen the biggest push to bring more traditional software-like interactions to the web. Dozens of organizations, big and small, are trying to make their mark creating <em>the</em> framework for building these “next-generation” web-based app experiences. Honestly, I don’t have a problem with that. I don’t really have an interest in client-side frameworks, but I don’t have a problem with them either… provided developers who wish to bring their programming talents to the web take a little time to learn about the medium.</p>

<p><span data-quotable="">If you don’t take the time to understand how the web works, you’ll spend half your time cursing it and the other half trying to work around the things that frustrate you (which you will probably write off as “poorly designed” or “ill-conceived”).</span> If you don’t understand how the web works, you’ll build fragile experiences that collapse like a house of cards when any one of your many dependencies—the network, JavaScript, some particular element or browser API—isn’t available. If you don’t understand how the web works, what you build will simply be <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/8245">on the web, not of it</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t particularly care much about bringing “native like” “60fps” experiences to the web. It’s not that I don’t write software (I do), I just don’t really care if something I make for the web feels like a piece of installed software. I’ll do everything in my power to ensure my users have a great experience, but I know that each person’s experience will be a little bit different and I no longer feel the need to enforce my will on their experience. I’d rather create many ways for someone to interact with the things I build and hope one or more of those work well for whoever happens by and whatever device they happen to be using.</p>

<p>Native software and the web have always co-existed. We had installed software on computers long before the web even existed and we will continue to have installed software for as long as there are computers. Some software will move to the web if it makes sense for it to do so. Other software will remain native. Either option could be right or wrong depending on what you are trying to do. For instance, I would never personally write a photo editor in the browser because image processing requires a lot of memory and CPU cycles. Putting it in a browser moves it one more level away from the hardware. Abstraction eases development, but it invariably increases overhead and reduces performance.</p>

<p>Traditional software and the web can and should co-exist. They also can and should continue to inform one another. Ultimately, that will help us better serve the needs of our users, however they use our creations.</p>

<h2 id="change-vs-stagnation">Change vs. Stagnation</h2>

<p>Underpinning this whole “native vs. web” thing is, I think, a feeling many of us old-timers have that our web—the web we grew up building—is slipping away from us. We cling to the idea of the web as an open platform<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> for people to share their thoughts, passions, and cat photos. We like the web as it was originally. We like the web as we made it.</p>

<p>The web is changing. In some ways it’s changing for the better, in some ways for the worse. It’s a far different beast today than <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">when Tim Berners-Lee typed that first <code>&lt;HEADER&gt;</code></a> and you can certainly do a lot more in the browser now than you could when I first picked up HTML. But I don’t think halting progress on the web is desirable.</p>

<p>As Jake points out in his response, stagnation is not a good policy. Stagnation pretty much killed BlackBerry. It also led to a lot of developer frustration in the guise of IE 6.</p>

<p>Change is not inherently bad. It’s pace can be quite frustrating at times, though. PPK certainly seems to be feeling that way about its speed now just as <a href="https://infrequently.org/2007/09/slides-from-my-standards-heresy-talk/">Alex Russell lamented its plodding progress back in 2007</a>. But when you take a step back, especially with a historical perspective, you see the changes are cyclical in many ways. The bandwidth issues we dealt with during the dial-up era are with us again in the form of mobile networks. The lessons we learned building a web for 640x480 screens are equally applicable in a world of wearables. And the text-based interactions we created in the very early days will serve as a template as we move boldly forward into the realm of voice-driven user experiences.</p>

<h2 id="cutting-edge-vs-craft">Cutting Edge vs. Craft</h2>

<p>In his post, PPK also complained that we’re simply getting too many new features on the web, which makes it hard to keep up. More than that, however, it makes it hard to truly come to a deeper understanding of how these different pieces work. To really hone our craft. In other words, it’s becoming harder to be an expert generalist.</p>

<p>Jake and Bruce completely get this, as do I. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/web-design-day/sdpbgz/">Lyza Danger Gardener has even given an amazing talk on the topic</a>. The sheer volume of new drafts, specs, and concepts (not to mention tooling options) is overwhelming. I’m sure I don’t know half of the features that are in the HTML5 spec, let alone the umpteen CSS3 modules. I probably never will. And I’m ok with that. I’ll pick and choose the bits I’m interested in playing around with and find ways to integrate them into my practice a little at a time. That’s how we learn. That’s how we’ve always learned.</p>

<p>To assuage PPK’s fears, however, I would argue that there are a lot more of us working on the web now than there were in the more leisurely paced days he remembers so fondly. And we’re sharing what we learn. Whether driven by altruistic desire to spread knowledge or an interest in rockstar-like fame in the industry (or even a smidge of both), it doesn’t really matter how it happens—the fact is that it does. We learn and we share. And the tools we have today make it even easier to do so. Not only do we have the usual magazine and blogging outlets, but we also have CodePen and JS Bin and Github and more.</p>

<p>We each have the capacity to research the hell out of one specific area of web design and be the conduit for that knowledge into the web design hive mind. Look at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sara+soueidan+svg">Sara Soueidan with SVG</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rachel+nabors+css+animation">Rachel Nabors with CSS Animation</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Zoe+Mickley+Gillenwater+flexbox">Zoe Mickley Gillenwater with flexbox</a>. <span data-quotable="">Individually, we will never be able to learn it all, but collectively we can.</span> Together, we can tackle any problem by accessing what we need to know when we need to know it.</p>

<h2 id="developer-convenience-vs-user-needs">Developer Convenience vs. User Needs</h2>

<p>Another angle in this very dense piece from PPK was around tooling and polyfills:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We get ever more features that become ever more complex and need ever more polyfills and other tools to function—<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/tools_dont_solv.html">tools that are part of the problem</a>, and not of the solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole “polyfill it and move on” movement has him a little annoyed. I share his sentiment. I don’t think a JavaScript-based solution should be considered “good enough” for interop. <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">JavaScript is not guaranteed.</a> Moreover, JavaScript implementations are also never going to be as fast as a browser implementation. If browsers want to pick up a polyfill and implement it behind the scenes, that’s fine because it will run faster, but loading up our websites with potentially megabytes worth of polyfills in order to use new “standards” seems ludicrous.</p>

<p>As an industry, we are doing an awful lot of navel gazing. <span data-quotable="">We are spending more time solving our own development problems (legitimate in some cases, fabricated in others) by throwing more and more code at the problem.</span> As a consequence, our users are paying the price in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks">slower sites</a>, <a href="http://www.soasta.com/blog/page-bloat-average-web-page-2-mb/">heavier web pages</a>, <a href="http://www.yottaa.com/bid/277715/Why-Your-Website-Is-Slow-Poor-JavaScript-Performance">poor performance</a>, and <a href="http://farukat.es/journal/2015/02/708-how-flipboard-chose-form-over-function-their-web-version">bad experiences</a> (or <a href="http://sighjavascript.tumblr.com/">no experience</a>). And, on top of that, we’re solving <em>our</em> problems not <em>their</em> problems.</p>

<h2 id="all-is-not-lost">All is not lost</h2>

<p>We are designers. Design is about solving problems for our users, not creating new ones for them. Whether we are writing code, sketching interfaces, authoring copy, curating content, or building servers, we should make each and every decision based on what will benefit our users. If it means we can’t use some shiny new technology, so be it. We can still play with the new stuff in our own browser, on our personal sites, and on CodePen. We can learn about them in our own experimentation and share that knowledge with the rest of our industry. We can improve our craft. The web can get better.</p>

    <link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/harvard-and-mit-and-captioning/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-29T14:23:28-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/harvard-and-mit-and-captioning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has published Statements of Interest in two cases brought by the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) against <a href="http://www.ada.gov/briefs/harvard_soi.pdf">Harvard (PDF)</a> and <a href="http://www.ada.gov/briefs/mit_soi.pdf">MIT (PDF)</a>, respectively. The NAD is suing the two universities for violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because the video and audio materials they are making available as part of their online learning offerings are not captioned.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The DOJ Statements make it quite clear that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both the ADA and Section 504 currently obligate Harvard to provide effective communication to ensure equal access to its online programming services, and resolution of Plaintiffs’ claim involves a straightforward application of longstanding statutory and regulatory requirements. For more than two decades, federal courts have resolved effective communication claims brought under the ADA and Section 504 in a wide range of contexts, including claims alleging unequal access to goods, benefits and services provided through websites or other electronic media. And the Departments of Justice and Education have routinely required covered entities to ensure equal access to goods, benefits and services, electronic or otherwise, through the provision of captioning or other auxiliary aids or services. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he Department issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPRM”) on Accessibility of Web Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities and Public Accommodations, announcing the Department’s interest in developing more specific requirements or technical standards for  website accessibility. … In the ANPRM, the Department reaffirmed its longstanding position that the ADA applies to websites of public accommodations, and reiterated, consistent with the preamble to the 1991 regulations, that the ADA regulations should be interpreted to keep pace with developing technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither case has been settled yet, but the fact that the DOJ is siding with the NAD will lend more credence to their complaints and will likely result in one or both institutions settling out of court and, eventually, captioning their videos.</p>

<p>Captions are critical for the deaf and hard of hearing as they let them know what’s being said, who is saying it, how it’s being said, and inform them of any other sounds that are germane to the content. Reading captions is the equivalent of hearing with your eyes.</p>

<p>Are your videos captioned? If your content is aimed at a broad audience, it might be worth your time (and even your money) to get them captioned.</p>

<p>No doubt, accurate captioning is time-consuming. There are some ways of automating it (<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3038280">YouTube does this</a>, for instance), but there are also services like <a href="https://castingwords.com/">Casting Words</a>, <a href="https://www.rev.com/caption">Rev</a>, and <a href="http://www.3playmedia.com/">3Play Media</a> that will do it for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the HTML <code>video</code> element supports subtitles and captions via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track">the <code>track</code> element</a> (<a href="http://www.iandevlin.com/blog/2015/04/html5/html5-video-captions-current-browser-status">browser support</a>, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=track">Can I Use data</a>). YouTube also allows you to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796">add captions and subtitles to your videos manually</a>. But keep in mind that <a href="http://screenfont.ca/learn/">captions and subtitles are not the same thing</a>; captions need to capture more than just the words that are said.</p>

<p>I worked on one project where the client provided me with a spreadsheet detailing 1,400 different user agents that accessed the login screen for the m-dot site. In two days!</p>

<p>As further evidence, consider <a href="http://blog.jasonsamuels.net/post/21633531278/analytics-confirm-the-need-for-adaptive-web-design">the enlightening details of this post from Jason Samuels</a> of the National Council on Family relations, a non-profit organization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2008, Internet Explorer dominated as the browser for 93.5% of their visitors. By 2014, that percentage had fallen to 19.7%, with Chrome bringing in the lion’s share of the traffic (37%). Firefox narrowly beat out IE with a 20% share of users.</li>
  <li>In 2008, visits from “mobile” devices accounted for only about 0.1% of their traffic. In 2014, that number had skyrocketed to 14.4%.</li>
  <li>In 2008, they detected 71 different screen resolutions, which is already a lot to consider. By 2014, however, they were seeing 1,000 unique screen resolutions each and every quarter (with over 200 of those recording 10+ visits per quarter).</li>
</ul>

<p>That last stat blows my mind every time I read it. You can’t design for 200 different screens, let alone 1,000. It’s a fools errand. And don’t even think of trying to test on that many devices.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are designing websites that can (and will) go anywhere. We need to thoroughly test because we can’t make any assumptions about the browsers and devices being used to access our content.</p>

<p>Testing can be tedious, time consuming, and costly. Surely there’s a way to make it easier. There sure is: Instead of getting hung up on creating one experience that needs to be nearly identical on every browser, we can be smarter about how we build things and treat experience as a continuum.</p>

<p>We can build websites that are both nimble enough to work on low powered devices over slow networks <em>and</em> smart enough to take advantage of advanced features and sensors when opportunity knocks.</p>

<p><em>Wha?! We can have our cake and eat it too</em>? Yes. Yes we can.</p>

<h2 id="start-on-solid-footing">Start on Solid Footing</h2>

<p>When dealing with the insane proliferation of web-enabled devices and the great unknown of where our websites will go, it pays to take a step back and focus on what’s important. We need to ask ourselves two simple questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the purpose of this page, this form, this interface?</li>
  <li>What is the simplest way to realize that purpose?</li>
</ol>

<p>Then we need to build that <em>first</em>. Typically we’re talking text, some basic HTML, actual links to other pages, and forms that submit to a back-end of some sort. This is our minimum viable product and it will work anywhere.</p>

<p>Then we can look for opportunities to enhance the experience, all while keeping that functional core at the center of the experience.</p>

<p>We can use CSS to add visual hierarchy to the page, provide some visual interest, and adjust the layout to create a good reading experience on a wide range of screen sizes. We should start from the narrowest screen size we can imagine and <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/191977076000161793">let the content guide our breakpoint decisions</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll use JavaScript to give real-time feedback to our users. <a href="http://domscripting.com/presentations/xtech2006/">We’ll hijack forms and links</a> to <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax-includes-modular-content.html">lazy load additional content</a> or otherwise avoid full-page refreshes. Heck, we can even take over the entire page and <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/">convert it into a single page app</a>.</p>

<p>But we should never sacrifice the functional core. </p>

<p>This approach to designing for the web is called <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a> and it’s the number one tool for dealing with the one-two punch of older browsers and device proliferation.</p>

<h2 id="be-conservative-in-your-delivery">Be Conservative in Your Delivery</h2>

<p>What makes progressive enhancement so helpful when it comes to dealing with this swirling mass of devices and browsers is that the core experience will <em>always be</em> available. There is nothing precluding our users from accessing it, even on a crappy WAP browser or a text-based browser like Lynx or even some <a href="http://www.theubi.com/">no so far-future talking computer</a> that only “sees” the web as text.</p>

<p>In order to ensure we don’t accidentally deliver advanced features to less capable browsers like these, we just need to be smart about how we load stuff like CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Some basic CSS—think typography, color, etc.—will be usable by just about anyone, so we can put all that stuff in one CSS file (e.g., <code>basic.css</code>) and include it with a standard <code>link</code>. Then we can tuck all of our layout rules and other advanced CSS into a separate CSS file (e.g., <code>advanced.css</code>) that we link to with an associated media query.</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/166b285a4fe3d854b97b.js?file=css-linking.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;default.css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
	&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;advanced.css&quot; media=&quot;only screen&quot;&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Any <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu/106">browsers that don’t understand media queries will ignore the second CSS file entirely</a> and receive only the linear, mobile view. Easy peasy, and IE8 gets the mobile layout (a baseline level of support that is not likely to cause you any testing headaches).</p>

<p>You can even take things a step further and use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports">the <code>@supports</code> block</a> within <code>advanced.css</code> to limit certain rule sets to only the browsers that support specific CSS features.</p>

<p>Of course, CSS support issues are nothing compared to JavaScript, so sometimes it’s best not to deliver certain bits of JavaScript-based functionality to browsers that can’t handle it. This is where <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html">feature (and object) detection</a> becomes incredibly useful:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/166b285a4fe3d854b97b.js?file=feature-test.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>if ( &#39;querySelector&#39; in document ) {
	// We can use querySelector!
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment#Downlevel-revealed_conditional_comment">inverted conditional comments</a> to prohibit older versions of IE from getting JavaScript in the first place (which means you don’t even need to worry about debugging JavaScript there). Here’s an example that hides <code>main.js</code> from IE8 and below, but makes it available to IE9 on up and to every other non-IE browser.</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/166b285a4fe3d854b97b.js?file=no-script-in-lte-ie8.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;!--[if gt IE 8]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;
	&lt;script src=&quot;main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>By being conservative in what we deliver to browsers we <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/">ensure the greatest level of support, but can still optimize for more advanced ones</a>. This makes testing so much easier because we know older browsers will be okay with the basics and we aren’t trying to use JavaScript features unless we know they’re available.</p>

<h2 id="test-test-test">Test, Test, Test</h2>

<p>Progressive enhancement helps us avoid a lot of rendering and scripting issues before we even get to the testing phase of a project, but eventually we do need to sit down and run our projects through their paces.</p>

<p>In order to keep testing manageable during development, it’s best to test in one browser we know to have good web standards support. It will provide a basic gut-check for our work. Once we are pretty confident things are working as they should be, we can begin more thorough testing on a variety of browsers and devices.</p>

<p>I personally keep several versions of each major browser on my laptop at any given time. I work on a Mac, so I typically have a few versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera lying around. You can get older versions of these browsers here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-continuous/index.html">Chromium Archive</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/">Firefox Archive</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/download//?custom=yes">Opera Archive</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s near-impossible to get older versions of Safari running on modern versions of OS X, so I typically just have the latest version locally.</p>

<p>For testing on Windows versions of said browsers, I typically have anywhere from 3-5 virtual machines running various Windows versions with their associated browser version and (typically) a copy of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera for good measure. The MS Edge Dev site offers <a href="http://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/">free Windows VMs for download</a>. If you’re just looking to get a gut-check in the latest and greatest from Microsoft, there’s also <a href="https://remote.modern.ie/">the Remote.IE service</a>, which allows you to connect to a virtualized version of the browser.</p>

<p>If you develop on Windows or Linux, you’ll need access to a Mac or you’ll have to rely on virtualization to test on that platform. I’ll discuss virtualization in a moment.</p>

<p>Once you’ve thoroughly tested in the various desktop browsers, it’s time to take the deep dive into the world of devices. If you’re unsure where to begin, take a look at your analytics, but take them with a grain of salt. Analytics can lead you to make false assumptions. For example, if you see a low percentage of Blackberry users, could that be because your site just doesn’t work well in Blackberry so they don’t stick around (or come back)? Beware the self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>If you have the budget, by all means pick up some devices to have on hand for testing. You can use tools like <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/inspect">Adobe’s Edge Inspect</a>, <a href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/">Vanamco’s Ghostlab</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/viljamis/Remote-Preview">Viljami Salminen’s Remote Preview</a> (or a combination of all of the above) to synchronize browsing on a handful of devices. Some of these tools also allow for remote inspection of the device to debug CSS and JavaScript. <a href="http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre-docs/latest/">Weinre</a> (which Adobe Edge Inspect uses) and <a href="http://vorlonjs.com/">Vorlon.js</a> also provide remote inspection functionality.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to have one nearby, you should stop by your local <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">open device lab (ODL)</a> to run your tests. ODLs are free community resources, typically offered by a web design studio or an individual who happens to be sitting on a ton of devices. Someone at the ODL should be able to help you pick out devices to test on and introduce you to the testing tools they have available in the lab.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an ODL nearby, you can also do some guerrilla-style testing in your local mobile phone or electronics store. Just make sure they have real devices… you won’t get far on the fake plastic ones.</p>

<p>If none of these are options for you, there’s always virtualization. You can download and install <a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/emulators">emulators for a variety of mobile browsers and devices</a>. Additionally, services like <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/">Browserstack</a> and <a href="http://crossbrowsertesting.com/">CrossBrowserTesting</a> offer access to hundreds of virtual desktops and devices for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>Virtualization will never give you the same experience as holding a real device in your hand. The performance is rarely the same and you don’t get any sort of feel for how the device responds to your input. I once stumbled on an Android 2.3 bug wherein generated content was being re-generated and re-inserted every time the device was rotated. I doubt I would have discovered that using an emulator. That said, emulators can help you get a rough idea of whether your interface works or not.</p>

<p>Regardless of the means by which you procure your testing devices, try to cover a good cross-section. Pick some low-end ones, a couple older high-end devices, and handful of the latest flagships, and a wide variety of screen sizes and resolutions. Make sure you have good coverage in terms of operating systems too—the latest iOS and Android versions are a given, but make sure you have a Windows device or two, a few Blackberry options, and some older Android and iOS versions in the mix. Then throw in <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/microsoft-kin-resurfaces-25-daily-deals-site/">an oddball</a> <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/have-39-spare-then-pick-odd-sylvania-7-netbook-windows-ce">or two</a> to see if your interfaces hold up.</p>

<p>It’s important to bear in mind that we will never be able to give each user on each device exactly the same experience. We need to be okay with that—experience is a continuum. As long as our users can accomplish what they need to on our sites, they will be well-served.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-points-embrace-patterns">Bonus Points: Embrace Patterns</h2>

<p>If we really want to make things easy on ourselves (and our team), we should consider building a <a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-pattern-libraries">pattern library</a> before we build a single page of our website.</p>

<p>Breaking our interfaces down into discrete, repeatable patterns (e.g., a label and form control, a tabbed interface, etc.) lets us look at each in isolation and test it that way too. Testing in isolation is far easier than trying to debug a page with a lot of moving parts.</p>

<p>Gathering our patterns into a live, web-based pattern library  allows anyone on our team to collect the patterns they need to build a given interface as easily as they’d assemble a plate at a smörgåsbord. And if we really want to streamline the building and testing process, we can even <a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/a-maintainable-style-guide/">make the patterns importable into the live site</a> so everything stays in sync.</p>

<h2 id="dont-fear-the-zombie-apocalypse">Don’t Fear the Zombie Apocalypse</h2>

<p>With the constant onslaught of new devices, form factors, and considerations, it’s tempting to throw up our hands and find another line of work. The pace of advancement is so brisk, it’s just hard to keep up, let alone feel like we’re on top of where things are headed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, however, all is not lost. By taking a step back and focusing on what matters, embracing experience as a continuum, and being deliberate in how (and when) we deliver certain features and functionality to browsers, we’ll head most issues off at the pass.</p>

<p>This relieves some of the pressure (and frustration) from the testing process and frees us up to test on a wider variety of devices and browsers, which means we’ll be able to provide a solid experience for more users, no matter what marvel of technological wizardry they happen to be using at the time.</p>

<p>Everybody wins.</p>
