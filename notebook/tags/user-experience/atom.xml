    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think we can all agree, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> is a problem. A 2014 study by Harvard Law School determined that <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9282809&amp;fileId=S1472669614000255/">roughly 50% of the URLs referenced in U.S. Supreme Court opinions no longer work</a>. That’s <em>terrifying</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>When I was mid-way through writing <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/">the Second Edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite></a>, I realized that it was pretty likely some of the links I was referencing might disappear over the years. Little did I know, some of them would disappear <em>while I was writing the book!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a> is pretty good, but it doesn’t archive everything, and I often find captured pages end up broken—especially if they rely heavily JavaScript, but often images go missing as well. I wanted to make sure that when you pick up the book a year from now or even 10 years from now, the links will still work.</p>

<p>I evaluated a few options for creating a permanent archive of each and every link in the book (there are over 200), but then it dawned on me that <a href="https://perma.cc/">Perma.cc</a> might be the perfect answer.</p>

<p>Perma.cc was created by the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> in reaction to the paper I mentioned earlier. It is a distributed archive of URLs for scholarly and legal documents, supported not only by Harvard, but over 90 (<em>and counting!</em>) libraries, distributed all over the world. <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma">It’s also open source</a>. Each <a href="https://perma.cc/docs#archive-formats">URL is preserved as a live view, an archived view, and a screen capture</a> taken when the link is added. Archived URLs are kept for a minumum of 2 years, but <a href="https://perma.cc/docs#vesting-links">may be “vested” into the permanent archive by a member organization</a>.</p>

<p>I had contributed some CSS to the project a while back, so I reached out to my contacts to see if they might be interested in vesting all of the links for the book. Turns out they were big fans of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/">the First Edition</a> and enthusiastically offered their support.</p>

<p>Converting all of the links took time (and a lot of double- and triple-checking), but the result is that every article, blog post, and web page that I referenced in the book will remain accessible to you in perpetuity. I think that’s pretty awesome. And, as an added bonus, since Perma.cc creates unique URLs that are relatively short, those of you who read it in print won’t have to re-type the often incredibly-lengthy original URLs.</p>

<p>I can’t thank <a href="http://mattphillips.info/">Matt Phillips</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/abziegler">Adam Ziegler</a>, <a href="http://jackcushman.org/">Jack Cushman</a>, and everyone else at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab enough for creating Perma.cc <em>and</em> for offering their service to my readers. You all are amazing!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest challenges of progressive enhancement lies not with the coding, but with the planning. It can be incredibly challenging to articulate how a single interface might adapt to a wide variety of situations. Interface Experience Maps (Ix Maps) can help.</p>

<!-- more -->

<hr />

<p>Back in 2007, I was presented with this challenge while putting together a talk called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070515221318/http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060214">Ruining the User Experience</a> (which I co-presented for the first time with at SXSW with <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahbeee">Sarah B. Nelson</a>). In the talk, Sarah and I discussed how to treat JavaScript as an enhancement and what happens when you don’t—in 2007, I know!</p>

<p>Anyway, in the talk I was struggling to convey the various decision points and interface adjustments that would happen as a result of those decisions. I don’t remember which of us came up with the idea—it was probably Sarah—but we opted to use a flowchart to visually describe what we were talking about on stage. Here was the first one we did:</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-05-28-01" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>An early flowchart used to describe progressive enhancement with JavaScript</figcaption></figure>

<p>It was pretty rudimentary, but it got the point across.</p>

<p>In future iterations of the talk, I expounded upon the idea of a flowchart for describing how an interface might adapt to different circumstances and browser capabilities. Here’s a particularly complex one I used to describe how a FAQ might function:</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-05-28-02" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>A flowchart describing the progressive enhancement and interaction options for an FAQ.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Over the years I found more and more ways to put these artifacts to use. And at a certain point, “flowchart” didn’t seem to cut it, so I began calling them “UI construction flows”—which, admittedly, was a mouthful—and then finally settled on the name “Interaction Experience Maps” with the help of a client.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-ix-maps">The Benefits of Ix Maps</h2>

<p>Ix Maps have become an invaluable tool to me and the teams I’ve worked with. They excel at articulating the different ways in which a given interface might adapt and what the end results of each adaptation might be.</p>

<p>This sort of documentation is invaluable to just about everyone on the team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copywriters get a clear picture of the different experience possibilities so they can craft the copy accordingly;</li>
  <li>Designers can see the different experience possibilities and can create wireframes and visual designs that account for each;</li>
  <li>Developers get a clear outline of what functionality is expected and know exactly what features and capability detection to employ in generating each experience; and</li>
  <li>The quality assurance team has a clear picture of what they should be looking for in each component of an interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, Ix Maps ensure everyone on the team has a clear picture of what’s expected so they can work toward the common goal. One company I worked with found Ix Maps so useful that they created one for each and every pattern in their pattern library. Then they included the drawings as part of each pattern’s documentation.</p>

<h2 id="ix-maps-facilitate-collaboration-and-iteration">Ix Maps Facilitate Collaboration and Iteration</h2>

<p>An Ix Map is a pretty simple concept for anyone to come to grips with, making it a fantastic tool for enabling mixed teams—designers, developers, content folks, business strategists, etc.—to brainstorm ideas and build a strategy around progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Time and time again, I have seen these simple diagrams bring a diverse team together and help them quickly and easily come up with very creative ways to address complex interface problems. That’s why I frequently use them as a tool in the workshops I lead.</p>

<p>Because they are so basic, Ix Maps can be sketched out quickly on paper, a whiteboard, or in software like OmniGraffle. And their simplicity also makes it quite easy to explore different ideas of how to adapt things and you don’t have to worry about throwing away an idea that doesn’t play out because it’s only a few boxes and arrows… you haven’t invested any time in design or production.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/804756366246427/">my Beyond Responsive workshop</a> that illustrates the evolution of a tabbed interface Ix Map from basic into something that is far more appropriate for differently-sized screens:</p>

<h2 id="simple-powerful">Simple, Powerful</h2>

<p>Ix Maps have been incredibly useful to me and the dozens of teams I’ve worked with. They’ve helped us explore innovative ways to solve design challenges and have been an amazing touchstone to organize our work around. Give them a shot an I’m sure you’ll discover lots of ways to put them to use in your own projects.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-27T15:10:11-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/lies-damn-lies-and-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late last week I stumbled on a video from <a href="https://twitter.com/graemepyle">Graeme Pyle</a> that exposed a UX lie in the <a href="https://www.fnb.co.za/">First National Bank of South Africa</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><figure id="fig-gpBWwl-Ngak" class="figure figure--video"><div class="video-embed video-embed--youtube video-embed--4x3"><a class="video-embed__lazy-link" style="background-image:url(//i2.ytimg.com/vi/gpBWwl-Ngak/0.jpg);" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBWwl-Ngak" data-lazy-video-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gpBWwl-Ngak?autoplay=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3"><div class="video-embed__lazy-div"></div><div class="video-embed__lazy-info">Shocking discovery: fnb.co.za progress bar a placebo!</div></a></div></figure></p>

<p>On the off chance you don’t want to watch the video, I’ll recap: When accessing certain screens on the FNB site, a progress meter is shown to indicate new content is being flowed into the browser. But it’s not.</p>

<p>As Graeme uncovered, the site uses JavaScript to create the progress bar, but the progress is not tied to anything except some basic JavaScript logic. The progress bar has no grounding in reality. It uses timeouts and follows a steady incrementation for a bit, then jumps up randomly for a bit before finishing.</p>

<p>Taking the easy way out like this may seem like a non-issue, but what happens when your user loses network connectivity? You guessed it: The progress meter still runs. <em>Doh!</em></p>

<p>Tracking true activity progress (like time to upload a file) involves constant communication between the server and the client. It used to be pretty difficult to do (and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lgoddard/CGI-ProgressBar-0.05/lib/CGI/ProgressBar.pm">required Perl</a>), but nowadays we have <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">WebSockets</a> and it’s much easier to keep the lines of communication between client and server open.</p>

<p>There is no reason to fake a progress bar. It’s pointless. Especially when you don’t even check to see if the user’s connection is still online.</p>
