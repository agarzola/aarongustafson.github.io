    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the last few years I’ve been running a workshop alternately titled “Planning Adaptive Interfaces” or “Beyond Responsive”, depending on the conference. It’s been one of my favorite workshops to run for a number of reasons, but before I get into that, let me explain what it is and how it works.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I think we all recognize how much Ethan’s seminal article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">“Responsive Web Design”</a> (and <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">his follow-up book</a>) shook up our industry. It changed the way we look at visual design and kindled (or in some cases re-kindled) an interest in catering an experience to mobile devices. But simply incorporating responsive design’s three core strategies—fluid grids, flexible media, media queries—is not the goal; meeting our user’s needs is. Responsive design is not an end in itself… it’s just the beginning.</p>

<p>We need to embrace the heterogenous nature of the Web—myriad connected devices with vastly different screen sizes (if they even have screens), network connectivity, and capabilities in use by countless individuals, each with their own special needs—and craft experiences that will work anywhere at any time. We need to build robust systems that adapt in ways far beyond aesthetics. I designed this workshop to explore the rich variety of use cases that often get overlooked in the course of building web projects and to show how we can begin considering them as early as possible.</p>

<p>When I was starting out, I gave “workshops” that basically amounted to a half-day or (worse) a full day for folks to listen to me blather on about one topic or another. People liked them, but I wouldn’t call them fun. And, in hindsight, I question how much value people got from an extended survey of what’s possible without the opportunity to put that knowledge to use. Workshops should encourage attendees to get their hand dirty.</p>

<p>I kick this workshop off with a relatively brief discussion of the considerations that we should be aware of—beyond screen size and pixel density. I also provide examples of how to adapt interfaces so they rise to meet our customers’ needs. Then I throw out a list of common interface patterns—modals, tabs, etc.—and turn the floor over to the attendees, asking them to build small teams that each examine a single pattern in detail with these considerations in mind. They then spend the rest of the workshop planning out how that interface would adapt to consider factors like accessibility, screen dimensions, device capabilities, JavaScript availability, and so on. All the while, I circulate among the groups, asking and answering questions, pressing them to go a little further with each iteration. Some teams sketch, some prototype, and all spend a lot of time debating, which is awesome!</p>

<p>I leave the last hour or so for a group discussion of what each team’s accomplished. It gives them a chance to talk through their approach, what they learned, what their pain points were, and how they overcame them. Not does it celebrate their work, but it helps the other attendees discover novel ways to approach these common UI constructs.</p>

<p>It’s been a blast and I have learned so much from the teams I’ve coached. Each workshop is completely different because each group of attendees is completely different. I’ve run it with groups ranging from 12 to 120, for internal teams at large companies to mixed audiences from all over the world. Everyone who has attended one of these workshops has brought a unique perspective and helped us all get better at our jobs. That’s been one of the best parts of this experience for me.</p>

<p>If a workshop like this sounds up your alley, I’ll be giving it a few more times in 2016. Your next opportunity will be at <a href="http://enhanceconf.com/workshop.html">EnhanceConf in London in early March</a>. Later in the year, I’ll be giving it as part of <a href="https://buildright.io/maker-series/2016/aaron-gustafson">Sparkbox’s Build Right: Maker Series</a>. I’d love the opportunity to work with you if you can make it!</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/progressive-enhancement-gets-a-conference/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-15T15:00:51+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/progressive-enhancement-gets-a-conference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On March 4th, I’ll be in London to give the closing talk at <a href="http://enhanceconf.com/">EnhanceConf</a>, the first conference dedicated progressive enhancement. Over the last few months, I’ve been talking to the conference’s organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/simonmcmanus">Simon McManus</a>, quite a lot. He’s put a lot of thought into the conference and I thought it might be interesting to  interview him so he could share his motivations and hopes for the event.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> As a philosophy, progressive enhancement has been around for more than a dozen years. Why do you think it needs a conference now?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I first started thinking about EnhanceConf in 2014. At the time, Tom Dale had declared progressive enhancement dead and I had just heard Henrik Joreteg telling his Single Page Story.I was hearing lots of talk about progressive enhancement being hard and expensive when my experience showed quite the opposite.</p>

<p>It’s been fascinating to watch how views have changed since, Tom Dale now loves progressive enhancement and Henrik likes to do as much of his rendering at build time as possible.</p>

<p>As the web continues to grow in weird and wonderful ways techniques like progressive enhancement just keep giving more and more value.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> What does progressive enhancement mean to you?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I try to build applications that provide the best possible experience to the end user. Regardless of who they are, where they are or what device they are using. For me, that means using progressive enhancement in every part of the stack.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement is about so much more than whether an app work with JavaScript turned off, realising we don’t have control over the runtime environment and building applications in the most robust way possible is far more important.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> Do you think it’s an approach that everyone should use on every web project?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I guess that depends on what you mean by a web project. In my mind to work on the web, you have to give up that illusion of control. You need to assume as little as possible about the device or user and for me that fits very well with progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Web technologies transcend the capabilities of any one device with their reach alone, it seems strange to me when people use them but don’t take full advantage.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> If a web designer or developer is only passingly familiar with progressive enhancement and is considering coming to the event, what should they expect to get out of it?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> These are probably the people with the most to benefit from EnhanceConf.</p>

<p>We are going to start the day looking at why progressive enhancement is still important on the modern web, so that should provide a nice intro for anyone who is not already familiar with progressive enhancement.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> What about a seasoned practitioner who already applies this philosophy to their work?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> Originally, EnhanceConf was a very selfish idea. I wanted to learn more about the tools and techniques being in use in industry: Over the last few years contracting I’ve seen many in use in that just weren’t surfacing at conferences.</p>

<p>EnhanceConf is about the state of the art in progressive enhancement, I’d like to think EnhanceConf will be the perfect event for such people to come together and learn from one another.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> What if the person thinks progressive enhancement is a waste of time?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I’d really like to encourage these people to come along to the event, I think it’s important their voice is a part of this discussion so that we can learn from each other and move forward together.</p>

<p>With an open mind I think they should have a really good time, they might hear some viewpoints they disagree with, but there will be lots of opportunities for Q&amp;A to discuss those topics in detail.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> As a hyper-focused event, there’s a risk of it being a bit of an echo chamber. Have you taken steps to mitigate that possibility?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I hope by being a hyper-focused event we can move beyond the bikeshedding that so often surrounds such discussions.</p>

<p>But yes. I have taken a couple of steps to mitigate an echo chamber:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Duplicate content</strong>
If you take all the talks about progressive enhancement and put them all on the same day you would end up with a fair amount of similar content. There will be no generic talks about progressive enhancement at EnhanceConf. Each talk will dig into real examples to provide unique tales from the trenches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preaching to the choir</strong>
I’ve been reaching out to lots of different communities around London to bring as many voices into the discussions as possible. The other day I was at the Meteor London meetup talking about EnhanceConf. Tableflip (the organisers) even bought tickets for their whole company!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The event is also being recorded so anyone not at the event will be able to watch all the talks and Q&amp;A.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> You’re modeling the format of the event—four acts, each comprising three twenty-minute talks and a group Q&amp;A session—on Responsive Day Out. What was the draw of that approach?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> Yes, we get to hear lots of different viewpoints and then bring the speakers together for a Q&amp;A. This should allow new viewpoints to emerge from discussions and join related threads. It also means we get to spend each section focusing on a particular area.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> Can you talk a bit about your speaker selection process?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I had lots of people in mind to talk at EnhanceConf. To ensure we heard a wide range of viewpoints we also opened a call for proposals to which we received some superb submissions.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to have some trusted advisors who helped me out throughout the process. I’m really pleased with how the line-up turned out.</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> When the event is done and dusted, what are you hoping will happen?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> I’d quite like a holiday! :D</p>

<p>But seriously, I hope we can demonstrate how to maximise the benefits and minimise any costs associated with progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>If at the end of EnhanceConf we had a reasoned and nurturing community able to take discussions forward that would be a fine outcome. :)</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Me:</b> Do you think there will be another EnhanceConf?</p>

<p><b class="interview__attribution">Simon:</b> EnhanceConf is the first conference I’ve organised. It’s been an unfathomable amount of work and financial risk to get this far and it’s mostly been done in my evenings and weekends. That said, it has been quite fun.</p>

<p>I’d like to do some traveling this year, maybe 2018?</p>

<hr />

<p>EnhanceConf will take place March 4th at the <a href="http://www.thersa.org/">RSA House</a> in London. <a href="http://enhanceconf.com/tickets.html">Tickets are available on the conference website</a>. I will also be giving <a href="http://enhanceconf.com/workshop.html">a one-day workshop entitled Planning Adaptive Interfaces</a> on March 3rd as part of the conference. Seating is limited.</p>

<p>EnhanceConf is offering a small number of educational scholarships. For more information on the scholarships and how to apply, check out <a href="https://simonmcmanus.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/enhanceconf-scholarship/">Simon’s post about the program</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/speeding-things-up-with-service-worker-resource-hints-and-more/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-20T21:39:09+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/speeding-things-up-with-service-worker-resource-hints-and-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>User experience encompasses more than just the interface. Download speed, render performance, and the cost of accessing a site are often overlooked areas when it comes to the practice of UX, but they all affect how users experience what we build on the Web.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’m always looking for ways to improve these aspects of my own site. And, since it’s my own personal playground, I often use it as a test-bed for new technologies, ideas, and techniques. My latest adventure was inspired by a bunch of <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/">articles and posts I’ve linked to recently</a>, especially</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9775">Jeremy Keith’s “My First Service Worker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/serviceworker-for-offline/">Nicolas Bevacqua’s “Making a Simple Site Work Offline with ServiceWorker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/service-workers--dynamic-responsive-images-using-webp-images/10132/">Dean Hume’s “Service Workers: Dynamic Responsive Images Using Webp Images”</a>, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@cramforce/not-so-micro-optimizations-f867c47b832d#.satdv0fap">Malte Ubl’s “Not so micro optimizations”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After reading these pieces, I decided to see how much I could do to improve the performance of this site, especially on posts with a lot of images and embedded code samples, like <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/">my recent post on form labels</a>.</p>

<h2 id="using-resource-hints">Using Resource Hints</h2>

<p>To kick things off, I followed Malte’s advice and used <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/">Resource Hints</a> to <em>prime the pump</em> for any third-party servers hosting assets I use frequently (e.g. Disqus, Twitter, etc.). I used the code Malte references in <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">the AMP Project</a> as my starting point and <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/main/resource-hints.js">added two new methods (<code>preconnect()</code> and <code>prefetch()</code>) to my global <code>AG</code> object</a>. With that library code in place, I can call those methods as necessary from within my other JavaScript files. Here’s a simplified extract from <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/post/disqus.js">my Disqus integration script</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea resource-hints-sample.js embed %}</p>

<p>While a minor addition, the speed improvement in <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=resource%20hints">supporting browsers</a> was noticeable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="integrating-service-worker">Integrating Service Worker</h2>

<p>With that in the bag, I set about making my first <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Worker</a>. I started off gently, using Dean’s piece as a guide. I added a WebP conversion bit to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/tasks/gulp/images.js">my image processing Gulp task</a> to get the files in place and then I created the Service Worker. By default, <a href="https://gist.github.com/deanhume/c04478df744ce833925c#file-client-hints-service-worker-js">Dean’s code</a> converts <em>all</em> JPG and PNG requests to WebP responses, so I set it up to limit the requests to only those files being requested directly from my server. I have no way of knowing if WebP equivalents of every JPG and PNG exist on the open web (probably not), but I know they exist on my server. Here’s the updated code:</p>

<p>{% gist ff6aef09a10038e1728a webp-service-worker.js embed %}</p>

<p>When I began tucking to the caching possibilities of Service Workers, following Nicolas’ and Jeremy’s posts, I <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker/fetch-cached.js">opted to tweak Nicholas’ caching setup a bit</a>. I’m still not completely thrilled with it, but it’s a work in progress. I’m sure I will tweak as I get more familiar with the technology.</p>

<p>To keep my Service Worker code modularized (like my other JavaScript code), I opted to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker">break it up into separate files</a> and am using Gulp to merge them all together and move the combined file into the root of the site. If you’d like to follow a similar path, feel free to adapt this Gulp task (which builds all of my JavaScript):</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea gulp-scripts.js embed %}</p>

<p>As most of the walkthroughs recommended that you version your Service Worker if you’re doing any caching, I set mine up to be auto-versioned by inserting a timestamp (lines 23-27, above) into my Service Worker header file (line 3, below):</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea _header.js embed %}</p>

<p>Service Workers are still pretty new (and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">modestly supported</a>), but it’s definitely interesting to see what’s possible using them. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9844">Like Jeremy</a>, I want to do a bit more exploration into caching and how it may actually <em>increase</em> the monetary cost of accessing a website if not used properly. Like any powerful tool, we need to wield it wisely.</p>

<figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/dlmcYrvalMmAw/giphy.gif" alt="Animated GIF of a guy accidentally launching a board into his helper while power sanding." /></figure>

<h2 id="making-gists-static">Making Gists Static</h2>

<p>On particularly code-heavy posts (yes, like this one), I make liberal use of Gists. They’re quite useful, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/BinaryMuse/803483">the Gist plugin for Jekyll</a>, while good, still requests a script from Github in order to load the pretty printed version of the Gist. On some posts, that can mean 5 or more additional network requests, not to mention execution time for the JavaScript. It’s yet another dependency that could prohibit you from quickly getting to the content you’re looking for. Additionally, <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">if JavaScript should be available, but isn’t</a>, you get nothing (since the <code>noscript</code> content is only evaluated if JavaScript support isn’t available or if a user turns it off).</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, I decided to revise the plugin and make it capable of downloading the JavaScript code directly. It then extracts the HTML markup that the JavaScript would be writing into the page and just embeds it directly. It also caches the result, which is handy for speeding up the build process.</p>

<p>You can grab <a href="https://gist.github.com/aarongustafson/b98add8f3580f6707cf5">my fork of the Gist Jekyll Plugin as, well, a Gist</a>. It’s also <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/gist_tag.rb">in the source of this site on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hopefully-a-little-faster">(Hopefully) A Little Faster</h2>

<p>All told, these changes have gotten the render time of this site down significantly across the board.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Even more so on browsers that support Service Workers and Resource Hints. I’ll likely continue tweaking as I go, but I wanted to share my process, code, and thoughts in case any of it might be useful to you in your own work. In the end, it’s all about creating better experiences for our users. How our sites perform is a big part of that.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Sadly I forgot to run some speed tests prior to rolling out this change and I didn’t feel like rolling back the site, so I don’t have solid numbers for you. That said, it seemed to shave nearly 2 seconds off of the load time on heavy pages like the post I mentioned. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Again, I don’t have the numbers, but I am routinely seeing <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> reached between 400-600ms with Service Worker caching in play. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <updated>2015-10-20T16:43:16+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/on-adaptive-web-designs-second-edition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote the bulk of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> in early 2010 while taking a much-needed break from client projects. I had originally slated for it to be released just before the holidays that year, but life happened and the book did not make it out into the world until mid-2011. Six months is a long time in the technical world, and especially on the Web. A year is forever.</p>

<figure class="figure figure--cover"><a href="https://aarongustafson.github.io/adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/"><img src="https://aarongustafson.github.io/adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/cover-320.jpg" srcset="https://aarongustafson.github.io/adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/cover-320.jpg 320w, https://aarongustafson.github.io/adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/cover-600.jpg 600w, https://aarongustafson.github.io/adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/cover-800.jpg 800w, https://aarongustafson.github.io/adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/cover-1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width:37.5em) 250px, 50%" class="book__cover" alt="" /></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> was never meant to be a technique book. As web design books go, technique books have perhaps the shortest lifespan. Heck, some are even out of date before they come off the press. Rather than going down that road, I consciously positioned my book as a web design philosophy book—the code samples were merely there to demonstrate how the philosophy could be applied to your work. That simple choice is probably why <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> continued to have strong sales year-after-year and it’s the reason that book continues to rank highly on many recommended reading lists.</p>

<p>Despite the accolades and the obvious longevity the First Edition has enjoyed, I’ve had the itch to update it for the last year and a half. It’s not that the content is stale, it’s more that I’ve adjusted how I frame certain ideas within the topic of progressive enhancement. For instance, I regret my decision to sequester accessibility within its own chapter in the First Edition; it made it too easy to skip, to consider an after thought, a bolt-on. I wish I had integrated it into every chapter. Because of when I wrote it, there was also a lot of stuff I didn’t get the chance to cover. For instance, HTML5 was also pretty new (and not yet a Recommendation) at the time and ARIA was still largely in flux, so I was only able to touch on bits and pieces of those. Ethan Marcotte’s seminal article “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a>”—and <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">his follow-up book by the same name</a>—came out after I’d written my CSS chapter, so I didn’t have the opportunity to demonstrate how that approach aligned with progressive enhancement.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Similarly, there were a lot Ajax-driven sites out there, but the “single-page app” movement hadn’t quite begun yet, so I hadn’t been able to square it with the progressive enhancement philosophy either. Similarly, the argument for progressive enhancement hadn’t yet been boiled down to “no JavaScript”, so I hadn’t even thought to address that.</p>

<p>When I mused about the Second Edition, I knew I wanted it to be more comprehensive and thorough. I had skimmed over content strategy the first time round—another regret—so I opted to give content its own chapter this time. I integrated accessibility into each and every chapter, showing how considering the “special needs” of your users can be accomplished with the copy you author, HTML you write, CSS you apply, and JavaScript enhancements you make. (Accessibility is important and everyone needs to be exposed to its considerations, so I am very happy about that decision.) Finally, from an organizational standpoint, I knew I didn’t want to focus the lessons around a “project site”—I wanted to pull great examples of progressive enhancement from the wild and celebrate them.</p>

<p>My target length for the Second Edition was a modest increase from 135 pages to around 160. When all is said and done, it’ll be closer to 250. It’s a lot of content, but I did my best to keep it approachable, like a really good conversation we might share over a few drinks.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I finished writing the Second Edition about a month and a half ago and have read and re-read it several times since then. I’m quite happy with the end result and I hope you will be too. I plan to get some of the content out there for you to read before deciding whether to purchase it, but in the meantime you can <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/">read more about it on the updated book site</a>. I also encourage you to check out <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/read/foreword.html">Jeremy Keith’s amazing Foreword</a>—which, admittedly, made me a little misty—and <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/reviews/">the sweet things Ethan and Tim Kadlec had to say about the book</a> after reading it.</p>

      <p>Interestingly enough, Ethan’s book came out around the same time as <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite>, leading many people to think they were conflicting approaches, <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/on-adaptive-vs-responsive-web-design/">which is hardly the case</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
