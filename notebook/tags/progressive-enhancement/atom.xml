<hr>


<p>Back in 2007, I was presented with this challenge while putting together a talk called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070515221318/http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060214">Ruining the User Experience</a> (which I co-presented for the first time with at SXSW with <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahbeee">Sarah B. Nelson</a>). In the talk, Sarah and I discussed how to treat JavaScript as an enhancement and what happens when you don’t—in 2007, I know!</p>

<p>Anyway, in the talk I was struggling to convey the various decision points and interface adjustments that would happen as a result of those decisions. I don’t remember which of us came up with the idea—it was probably Sarah—but we opted to use a flowchart to visually describe what we were talking about on stage. Here was the first one we did:</p>

<p><figure id="fig-2015-05-28-01" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>An early flowchart used to describe progressive enhancement with JavaScript</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It was pretty rudimentary, but it got the point across.</p>

<p>In future iterations of the talk, I expounded upon the idea of a flowchart for describing how an interface might adapt to different circumstances and browser capabilities. Here’s a particularly complex one I used to describe how a FAQ might function:</p>

<p><figure id="fig-2015-05-28-02" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-05-28/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>A flowchart describing the progressive enhancement and interaction options for an FAQ.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Over the years I found more and more ways to put these artifacts to use. And at a certain point, &ldquo;flowchart&rdquo; didn’t seem to cut it, so I began calling them &ldquo;UI construction flows"—which, admittedly, was a mouthful—and then finally settled on the name "Interaction Experience Maps&rdquo; with the help of a client.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Ix Maps</h2>

<p>Ix Maps have become an invaluable tool to me and the teams I’ve worked with. They excel at articulating the different ways in which a given interface might adapt and what the end results of each adaptation might be.</p>

<p>This sort of documentation is invaluable to just about everyone on the team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copywriters get a clear picture of the different experience possibilities so they can craft the copy accordingly;</li>
<li>Designers can see the different experience possibilities and can create wireframes and visual designs that account for each;</li>
<li>Developers get a clear outline of what functionality is expected and know exactly what features and capability detection to employ in generating each experience; and</li>
<li>The quality assurance team has a clear picture of what they should be looking for in each component of an interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>In short, Ix Maps ensure everyone on the team has a clear picture of what’s expected so they can work toward the common goal. One company I worked with found Ix Maps so useful that they created one for each and every pattern in their pattern library. Then they included the drawings as part of each pattern’s documentation.</p>

<h2>Ix Maps Facilitate Collaboration and Iteration</h2>

<p>An Ix Map is a pretty simple concept for anyone to come to grips with, making it a fantastic tool for enabling mixed teams—designers, developers, content folks, business strategists, etc.—to brainstorm ideas and build a strategy around progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Time and time again, I have seen these simple diagrams bring a diverse team together and help them quickly and easily come up with very creative ways to address complex interface problems. That’s why I frequently use them as a tool in the workshops I lead.</p>

<p>Because they are so basic, Ix Maps can be sketched out quickly on paper, a whiteboard, or in software like OmniGraffle. And their simplicity also makes it quite easy to explore different ideas of how to adapt things and you don’t have to worry about throwing away an idea that doesn’t play out because it’s only a few boxes and arrows… you haven’t invested any time in design or production.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/804756366246427/">my Beyond Responsive workshop</a> that illustrates the evolution of a tabbed interface Ix Map from basic into something that is far more appropriate for differently-sized screens:</p>

<h2>Simple, Powerful</h2>

<p>Ix Maps have been incredibly useful to me and the dozens of teams I’ve worked with. They’ve helped us explore innovative ways to solve design challenges and have been an amazing touchstone to organize our work around. Give them a shot an I’m sure you’ll discover lots of ways to put them to use in your own projects.</p>

Here are a few tips that will help you embrace mobile without tearing your hair out.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Embrace mobile-first CSS</h2>

<p>This is a quick win. I’ve done the mobile-first overhaul on a number of existing sites over the last few years and the best strategy I’ve found is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create two CSS files. Name the first something like &ldquo;basic.css&rdquo; and link to it with <code>media="all"</code>. Name the second something like &ldquo;advanced.css&rdquo; and link to it with <code>media="only screen"</code>.</li>
<li>Move all of your existing desktop-only CSS into advanced.css and wrap the rules in a media query corresponding to your design width (e.g. <code>@media (min-width:60em)</code> for a 960px max width).</li>
<li>Open a page from your site in a new browser window and make it as small as possible. Move any basic typographic and color styles from advanced.css to default.css and refresh the page. How does it look? Make the browser wider. Still acceptable? Awesome! This is the CSS you’ll serve to older browsers that don’t understand media queries and it forms the basis of your larger screen styles.</li>
<li>Shrink the browser back down to the smallest it can go and create a breakpoint for that size in advanced.css (e.g. <code>@media (min-width:10.5em)</code> if you want to small target devices like the <a href="https://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a>). Move any styles you want applied in this scenario from your &ldquo;full screen&rdquo; breakpoint and add any new rules you need to make things look good.</li>
<li>Increase the browser width until the layout looks odd, then make a new breakpoint and move in or add the necessary styles.</li>
<li>Rinse &amp; repeat until you get up to the &ldquo;full screen&rdquo; layout.</li>
<li>Move your print styles—you do have print styles, right?—into default.css and wrap them in a print <code>@media</code> block.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Focus on key tasks</h2>

<p>Every page has a purpose. If it doesn’t, you don’t need it. Find the page’s purpose and make that the focus. Eliminate distractions and reduce the amount of friction a user encounters when trying to accomplish the task.</p>

<p>If company or client politics preclude you from getting rid of all distractions on a page, consider <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax-includes-modular-content.html">a lazy-loading strategy</a> to bring them in with JavaScript only when there is more screen real estate.</p>

<h2>3. Get smarter about images</h2>

<p>Images are great, but they often comprise the majority of a web page’s bulk. To slim things down, first consider whether a given image is actually needed. If it isn’t, get rid of it. If it offers an enhancement, but isn’t crucial, consider lazy-loading it after page load. If the image is really important, <a href="https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/">use <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code></a> (or the <code>picture</code> element) to deliver the smallest and yet most appropriate image to your users, based on their device.</p>

<h2>4. Embrace the continuum</h2>

<p>As designers and developers, we often try to control everything. But we have to realize that we can’t control everything on the Web. People on different devices have different capabilities and considerations. They will need your website to be flexible enough to allow them to accomplish their goals no matter what.</p>

<p>Understanding that is key to building experiences that move seamlessly across devices. You know, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a>. It’s key to embracing the Web for all of its inherent web-iness.</p>

<p>And there you have it: 4 simple, but effective guidelines for creating awesome websites that will fair well under Google’s new algorithm. And guess what: Your users will benefit too.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-02T10:14:40-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/how-to-apply-progressive-enhancement-when-javascript-seems-like-a-requirement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Stack Overflow last week, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4719194/jamham">JamHam</a> asked how to apply progressive enhancement in interfaces that seem to require JavaScript. Unfortunately he deleted the question before I could post my response, so I thought I would post it all here for posterity.</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to make my site (a content publishing &ldquo;web app&rdquo;) work fully without JavaScript, however, I&rsquo;ve found myself in situations where I can&rsquo;t honestly think how I would do some features without it.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a form submission page where you change certain settings, and the form changes accordingly.This is alright, I can apply query strings in the url and have some logic in my layout so that certain fields are shown/hidden according to the query string. The thing is, I also need to update a &ldquo;price&rdquo; dynamically, according to what fields are filled in, how they are filled in, and some other factors, and I don&rsquo;t honestly see how I could do that without JavaScript.</li>
<li>I have a messaging section where I&rsquo;m using WebSockets (with the help of Socket.io). The UI of the messaging (and of course, the
WebSockets) stuff pretty much depends on JavaScript, with &lsquo;messages&rsquo; being created as they arrive and appended into DOM and also a form that allows you to quickly look up an user via AJAX so you can send a message easily, among many other things.</li>
</ul>


<p>I mean, I could probably come up with very complicated solutions for each situation, and obviously the functionality wouldn&rsquo;t be the same. I&rsquo;m thinking I might as well just require JavaScript for the whole thing</p>

<p>But it kinda sucks, since I&rsquo;ve been making everything work without JavaScript, up until this point. And I would like some consistency across the whole site. In these kind of situations, is it acceptable to not support non-js clients? What would you suggest in this case?</p></blockquote>

<p>My response (which I was drafting when he deleted the question):</p>

<blockquote><p>First off, I applaud your interest in using progressive enhancement. It will ensure the most users possible have access to your content and will also result in a more robust application overall. As a general guiding principle, look to the past. How did we solve these issues before widespread JavaScript availability? Those &ldquo;Web 1.0&rdquo; solutions will still work and can be overtaken by supplanted by your JavaScript solution whenever it is possible to do so.</p>

<p>Every situation is different, but it is even possible to reuse a lot of code in both scenarios.</p>

<p>Now to address your interfaces…</p>

<p><strong>Your Submission Page</strong> &ndash; I could be wrong, but this sounds like a shopping cart to me (at least in essence). You are on the right track with query parameters, but you could also store info about the cart (and the user’s capabilities) in a session or cookie.</p>

<p>In terms of updating the &ldquo;cart&rdquo;, a simple &ldquo;update&rdquo; submit button that posts the form and triggers a redirection back to this page with the updated info would be sufficient. And if you need to show or hide fields based on choices made, you simply apply that logic on the server side. You could even have the server generate that same markup into the page, but hidden for situations where JavaScript is available.</p>

<p><strong>Your Messaging App</strong> &ndash; This can seem like a daunting challenge, but before we had web sockets and even Ajax, we relied on a small form which posts messages to the back end and a running feed of messages being sent from the back-end. One of the most common way to handle this involved frames and a &ldquo;meta refresh&rdquo; like this one:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That simple <code>meta</code> tag will make any browser refresh the page every 30 seconds. Now if you put that in an <code>iframe</code> to keep it from causing a refresh of the entire interface, any new messages would be picked up and displayed automatically at that interval (which you should tune to be appropriate for your app).</p>

<p>Once that is in place the page itself could even post to that frame by using the non-standard but well-supported <code>_target</code> attribute on the <code>form</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously with JavaScript enabled, you’d probably throw away that <code>iframe</code>, but the rest of the setup (including the templates for displaying the messages) could certainly be reused with WebSockets.</p></blockquote>

<p>I hope this helps. Progressive enhancement may seem like a huge challenge, but when you take a few moments to think about how we handled these challenges in the past, the way forward becomes clear.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-11T09:21:29-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/lines-in-the-sand</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new site, <a href="http://breakupwithie8.com/">Break Up with Internet Explorer 8</a> by <a href="http://www.humaan.com/">Humaan</a>, has been making the rounds on the Interwebs of late. It’s cleverly done and an attractive site, but I don’t really agree with the premise:</p>

<blockquote><p>Join the intervention and stop supporting IE8. It&rsquo;s time for an upgrade.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>The reality is that some users don’t have control over the browsers installed on their computers and <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2224510/microsoft-subnet/some-windows-xp-users-just-can-t-afford-to-upgrade.html">IE8 may be the best they can muster</a>. Most of us have had the luxury of moving on, but they haven’t. Does that mean we should banish those users from our sites by treating IE8 like that ex who just won’t take a hint? I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Instead, we should approach this problem rationally. Be the bigger person. Call it <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/">support vs. optimization</a>, call it <a href="http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard">cutting the mustard</a>, call it what you will, but by understanding how browsers work, we can reduce our own development headaches and serve more users in the process. Yes, even when they use aging browsers like IE8 or IE7 or (gasp) IE6.</p>

<p>When it comes to HTML and CSS, browsers ignore what they don’t understand. It’s why you can use the <code>section</code> element and the content will still be exposed in Lynx. It’s also why you can use RGBa without IE6 collapsing. <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/chapter-1.html#the-rise-of-tolerance">Fault tolerance is a really powerful tool</a> and is the foundation of progressive enhancement in HTML and CSS. (In JavaScript things are a little more complicated… we have to use <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/feature-browser-detection/">feature detection</a>.)</p>

<p>A simple way to rid yourself of IE8 related headaches is to embrace the idea that <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">web pages don’t need to look (or behave) the same in every browser</a> and look for ways to achieve this while still providing access to your content and tools for less-capable browsers and devices. For example:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/b9bca995a67ba298225d.js?file=css-filter.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;simple.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;complex.css&quot; media=&quot;only screen&quot;&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This simple stylesheet setup will deliver only the <code>simple.css</code> file to browsers that are incapable of understanding media queries. Browsers that do understand them will get both stylesheets. Media queries support is an easy line in the sand we can draw because <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu/79">lack of media query support is in fact the first media query</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, it’s as simple as putting all of your advanced styles in the <code>complex.css</code> file. No drama.</p>

<p>On the JavaScript end, you can draw a line in the sand too. Let’s say you don’t want to spend your time debugging JavaScript in IE8. You can just skip it using <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">Conditional Comments</a>:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/b9bca995a67ba298225d.js?file=js-filter.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;not-for-ie8.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Using an approach like this avoids delivering the contained JavaScript files to IE8 at all, but all other browsers will see them.</p>

<p>If that’s too drastic, use <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/feature-browser-detection/">feature detection</a> in your JavaScript files to determine if it is safe to rely on a particular method or capability. Program defensively.</p>

<p>Honestly, I’ve found that approaches like these lead to fewer grey hairs and a lower overall stress level. They make me a happier developer and let me concentrate on building for the future rather than worrying about the past.</p>

<p>But it’s not about breaking up with IE8, it’s about having a realistic and honest relationship with it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In more than a handful of conversations lately, it’s become quite clear that we, the web development community, are prioritizing our own convenience and our own time over that of our users.

<p>Fundamentally, I agree with his sentiment: A preprocessor should <em>not</em> be a requirement for authoring CSS. Thankfully, <em>it never was</em>; you can build amazing things using only hand-authored CSS. And if you find a preprocessor helpful to your process for one reason or another, great. But using a preprocessor never has been (nor should it ever be) a requirement.</p>

<p>But Chris was not railing against preprocessors. Instead, he is echoing a sentiment held by many people in the preprocessor community. He feels CSS is not as powerful as it could/should be and he hopes that one day soon preprocessors won’t need to exist because CSS will have all of the features they offer natively. Like variables.</p>

<p>I used to feel that way. I used to want variables… and mixins… and functions… and loops… and declaration block-level inheritance. But I’ve changed my mind.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love these constructs. I use them nearly every day in the SASS I write and I am incredibly thankful for the hard work that has gone into their creation and maintenance.  Chris alone has probably saved me several weeks worth of work over the last four years through his contributions to SASS and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>. I definitely owe him a beer (or three).</p>

<p>Ok, so if my issue is not with the idea of programmatically generating styles, why would I not want these to be part of CSS, the <i>lingua franca</i> for design on the Web? Well, it’s pretty simple: Converting all of these constructs into something that is actionable by the browser takes time and processing power. Someone has to pay that cost and I wouldn’t feel right passing that cost on to my end users if there are better options.</p>

<p>This is a topic I bring up often in my conference talks and workshops: Every decision we make affects the user experience in some way.</p>

<p>When we add another JavaScript library or plugin, it’s no big deal from our perspective. We tend to have fast connections and faster processors. For our users it’s another story: It’s one more thing to request. One more thing to download. One more script to parse. One more thing holding up page rendering. One more reason to leave our site and seek out a competitor who actually values their time.</p>

<p>When we hide an <code>img</code> in the small screen version of our responsive design using <code>display: none</code>, the cost to us is quite minimal. It’s just one little declaration. What’s the harm? But the cost to our end users is quite significant: Longer load times, slower performance, and (in some cases) in real dollars if they are on a <a href="http://blog.kaspersky.com/cost-aware/">metered data connection</a>. And they don’t even get to see the image they paid for!</p>

<p>When we decide to build a site using a front-end JavaScript MVC framework, it can make the development process go so much faster for us and we can reduce our need for a robust back-end infrastructure. I mean everyone has JavaScript these days… <a href="/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/">the browser is the new VM</a>. But when we do this, our users suffer because we don’t give their browsers real HTML. Instead we force them to download a hefty framework so we can move all of the processing we would normally handle on a much faster, dedicated server to their questionably-capable machine instead. Oh, and if the browser encounters an error while parsing or executing the JavaScript execution, they don’t get anything at all. Welcome to the Modern Web™!</p>

<p>When I look around, I see our community spending a lot of time coming up with new tools and techniques to make our jobs easier. To ship faster. And it’s not that I’m against efficiency, but I think we need to consider the implications of our decisions. And if one of those implications is making our users suffer—or potentially suffer—in order to make our lives easier, I think we need to consider their needs above our own.</p>

<p>So yes, I would love a world where preprocessors are unnecessary, but I would much rather spend a few seconds (or even a few minutes) transcompiling my SASS into CSS in order to save my users even a few milliseconds. It’s the same reason I optimize my images, minify my JavaScript, use Gzip, and lazy load design and experience enhancements only in contexts where they provide a real benefit.</p>

<p>Our users should never foot the bill for our convenience. We need to put their needs above our own.</p>
