<!-- more -->


<p>We&rsquo;ve all experienced this feeling: <em>I have no idea how many modules will be in this block, but I would love to lay them out differently depending on that number.</em> Short of writing exhaustive CSS to (hopefully, optimistically) cover all of your bases, we had not figured out a good way to do this.</p>

<p>Heydon to the rescue!</p>

<p>Here’s Heydon’s first quantity query example:</p>

<p>{% gist eddda1f32ed102cedd86 equal.css %}</p>

<p>With these selectors, the rule set would only apply if the total count of list items was exactly 6. Here’s what he is selecting:</p>

<ol>
<li>A list item (<code>li</code>) that is 6th sibling in a group of list item siblings when counted backwards (<code>:nth-last-child(6)</code>), but only if it is also the first of those siblings (<code>:first-child</code>); and</li>
<li>Any list item (<code>li</code>) siblings that follow the one selected above (<code>~</code>).</li>
</ol>


<p>Brilliant! <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/quantity-queries-for-css#section4">Heydon breaks it down way more eloquently</a> (and with illustrated squid to boot). To use this in your own projects, simply swap the &ldquo;6&rdquo; for whatever count you are looking for it to be equal to.</p>

<p>But Heydon doesn’t stop there. He also gives us ways to test for  more than or equal to and fewer than or equal to a certain number. We’ll start with the <br/>
&ldquo;more than&rdquo; variant (because everyone always wants more):</p>

<p>{% gist eddda1f32ed102cedd86 more-than-or-equal.css %}</p>

<p>This one is slightly more complex, using the <code>nth-*</code> formula to manage the calculation. In English, this selects:</p>

<ol>
<li>A list item (<code>li</code>) which is the sixth, seventh, eighth, etc. sibling in a collection of list item siblings when counted backwards from the end of that collection (<code>:nth-last-child(n+6)</code>); and</li>
<li>Any list item (<code>li</code>) siblings that follow the one(s) selected above (<code>~</code>).</li>
</ol>


<p>The magic is in the formula: <em>n+6</em>.</p>

<p>The way <code>nth-*</code> formulae work is that the &ldquo;n&rdquo; portion is about dividing the siblings into smaller groups based on the <em>n</em> multiplier. So &ldquo;2n&rdquo; means for every group of 2, &ldquo;3n&rdquo; means for every group of 3, and so on. In Heydon’s case, &ldquo;n&rdquo; simply means for every group of 1. The <em>n</em> multiplier starts as zero (for the first group) and then becomes 1, 2, 3, etc. in succession.</p>

<p>The number added or subtracted from this number (&ldquo;+6&rdquo; in the example) can be though of as the item in the count. Most often we see this in use as &ldquo;2n+2&rdquo; which stands for the second sibling in every group of two. It’s usually common to see this number be smaller than the grouping number (&ldquo;3n+2&rdquo;, &ldquo;5n+3&rdquo;, etc.). In Heydon’s example, however there is no grouping, so that logic doesn’t really apply. Instead you can think of it as simply adding the multiplier to 6: 0+6 (6), 1+6 (7), 2+6 (8), etc.</p>

<p>Now count from the end and then select that and everything that follows and you get a &ldquo;more than or equal to&rdquo; count based on the number (6 in his case, but again you can swap it out). Brilliant!</p>

<p>The final example he gives is for fewer than or equal to a particular number:</p>

<p>{% gist eddda1f32ed102cedd86 fewer-than-or-equal.css %}</p>

<p>This one is largely the same as the &ldquo;more than&rdquo; example, but the multiplier is reversed (with the minus sign) which means the count runs backward: 0+6 (6), -1+5 (5), -2+6 (4), and so on.</p>

<p>I am just overjoyed with how brilliant this is. I can think of so many places to use it (and will likely be doing so quite soon).</p>

<h2>Bonus: Now with SASS</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danielguillan">Daniel Guillan</a> has <a href="https://github.com/danielguillan/quantity-queries">ported this functionality (and more) to SASS</a> using a handful of really straightforward mixins. Here’s a demo:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll level with you: I used to think I wanted variables in CSS.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I love the idea of being able to abstract reusable bits like colors, border widths, font sizes, and the like to obviously named variables. It’s a far more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> approach and makes maintenance far easier.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Before I made the leap to using a CSS preprocessor, I was convinced we needed CSS variables, but I always wondered how we might make it possible without breaking one of the fundamental <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html#design-principles">design principles of CSS</a>: Forward and backward compatibility. Take a look at this example (which is based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/">the working draft spec</a>) and I think you’ll spot the problem:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 css-vairables.css %}</p>

<p>For a browser that understands CSS variables, the interpreted stylesheet would look like this:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 desired-result.css %}</p>

<p>But any browser that doesn’t understand the variables would never get the color values because browsers follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#parsing-errors">the rules of fault tolerance in CSS</a> and ignore anything they don’t understand. The introduction of variables to CSS would effectively build a wall between older browsers and new ones. (For the record, as of this writing, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">only Firefox has implemented CSS variables</a>).</p>

<p>In order to serve the broadest spectrum of devices, we’d have to provide a fallback like this:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 css-variables-fallback.css %}</p>

<p>But that kinda defeats the whole purpose, right?</p>

<p>Preprocessors already give us this access to variables today (along with nesting, mixins, and programmatic structures like conditionals, loops, etc.). Here’s a SASS example:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 sass-variables.scss %}</p>

<p>The big difference here is that this document is a source file, it is not what is sent to the browser. This file is compiled by the preprocessor into actual CSS, which is what we send to the browser and is exactly what we wanted in the first place:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 desired-result.css %}</p>

<p>And it works on every browser that supports CSS, all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Difficulty_with_adoption">IE 3</a>.</p>

<p>With a preprocessor like SASS, Less, or Stylus, I get all of the maintainability benefits without sacrificing browser support. It’s a no-brainer. But even if that were not true, there’s another issue to consider: If I push CSS variables to browsers, they have to parse the CSS and substitute the variables before they can apply the styles.</p>

<p>Now I’m sure browser makers can find ways to optimize this process, but it’s bound to affect the rendering time. And not in a positive way. I don’t even want to think about how bad it would be on a mobile chipset, especially on a low-end device.</p>

<p>Honestly, I love using variables… in the source files I use with a preprocessor. Given the potential loss of browser support, the pointless fallbacks I’d have to use if I wanted to continue supporting older browsers, the existence of numerous preprocessor options that solve the abstraction problem in a backward- and forward-compatible way, and the fact that CSS variables would make browsers have to work even harder to achieve the desired result, I’m not convinced we need them.</p>

<p>CSS variables are a bad idea.</p>
