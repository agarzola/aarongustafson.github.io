<!-- more -->


<p>Let me back up a bit here. As many of you know, I’ve been working on the Web for a long time and, like many old codgers, lived through the first browser wars and remember not only the unveiling of Internet Explorer 6—which was pretty amazing for its time—but I also worked on the Web for the entire 5 years that browser sat on the shelf.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>By the time Internet Explorer 7 came out in late 2006, there had been a number of advancements on the Web. And there was more competition for user and developer mindshare. Safari popped up shortly after IE6’s launch and was gaining traction on the Mac with its port of Konqueror’s layout engine, KHTML, which they renamed WebKit. Netscape was in it’s death throes, but Firefox arose from the ashes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and was capturing an ever-growing share of the market with its improved security, extensibility through browser plug-ins, and tabbed browsing. Not only that, but the Mozilla core of Firefox had also been spun into several other browsers that were similarly taking off: Camino, Flock, SeaMonkey, Galeon, and Epiphany. And then, of course, the Opera browser was still going strong on the desktop and growing rapidly in the mobile space.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>When IE7 finally made it out into the world, developers were at peak frustration when it came to dealing with standards-compatibility issues in IE. So it’s no surprise that the messaging focus for IE7 was, at least in terms of the Web designer/developer audience, focused on <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ie7-and-standards-compliance-microsofts-chris-wilson-charts-progress/">apologizing for the past and promising that they cared about (and were supporting) interoperable Web standards</a>.</p>

<p>And this was an earnest sentiment, it wasn’t bullshit. I remember <a href="https://twitter.com/cwilso">Chris Wilson</a>—then Platform Architect of Internet Explorer Platform team—telling me he had personally printed out <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">the entire CSS 2.1 spec</a> and put it on the desk of each developer working on Trident, the browser’s rendering engine.</p>

<p>And IE7, for all of its faults, was an improvement over IE6. A few years later, IE8 was an improvement over that. And, a little later, IE9 gave us a completely reborn Internet Explorer, largely free of the layout and rendering quirks we had earned so much grey hair fighting. And so on. And so on. But all the while, the drumbeat from the IE team was this: Now with more standards support!</p>

<p>And it wasn’t just IE that was making this claim. Other browsers began to tout their support of one particular standard or another that the others didn’t in hopes of getting developers to pay more attention to them.</p>

<p>Some time before the launch of IE8, I remember having a conversation with Chris Wilson over drinks at a conference. We talked at length about the state of Web standards, browsers, and the like. During the course of our chat, he offered up his dream:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ll be happy when browsers stop competing on standards support and start competing on chrome.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>It stuck with me because what he was saying made a lot of sense: Standards-compliance should be a given; browsers should be competing on the extra stuff they offer.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to today’s announcement. Standards-compliance wasn’t mentioned<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> by <a href="https://twitter.com/joebelfiore">Joe Belfiore</a> in his walkthrough of “Project Spartan”. Instead, Joe focused on the value adds in the browser: in-app note taking, a focused reading mode, cross-device synchronization, and Cortana integration.</p>

<p>This is a major milestone for IE in my opinion and it makes me wonder if we’ve finally reached the place that Chris dreamed about all those years ago. I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>I was told that, internally, decision-makers felt the browser was “done” and there would be no more advancements on the Web that would require a new browser.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>You may not realize it, but Opera Mobile predated even IE6. And it’s Opera Mini variant touts big numbers too: In April 2014, there were over 267 million Opera mobile browser users (244 million of whom used Opera Mini) and Opera Mini users viewed over 177 billion pages in that same month.

<li id="fn:5">
<p>The only phrases that even hint at standards compliance were “modern Web” and “a new rendering engine… that is compatible with how the Web is written today” (starting at around 59:05 in <a href="https://ll.ms-studiosmedia.com/events/2015/1501/Windows10CP/live/Windows10CP.html?title=Windows10CP-mscom">the video</a>).<a href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Egalitarianism]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/egalitarianism/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-19T10:32:20-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/egalitarianism</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is Martin Luther King Day in the United States, so I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on one aspect of equality I think is incredibly important: egalitarianism.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/egalitarianism"><cite class="book">Merriam Webster</cite></a>, egalitarianism is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>a belief in human equality especially with respect to social, political, and economic affairs;</li>
        <li>a social philosophy advocating the removal of inequalities among people.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>


<p>It’s a simple philosophy inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">the Golden Rule</a>, an ethical code which is central to most major religions:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Buddhism</dt>
    <dd>Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find harmful.</dd>
    <dt>Christianity</dt>
    <dd>Do unto others as you would have  them do unto you.</dd>
    <dt>Islam</dt>
    <dd>No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.</dd>
    <dt>Judaism</dt>
    <dd>What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man. That is the entire law; all the rest is commentary.</dd>
</dl>


<p>Heck, even Confucius said “Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself”.</p>

<p>With so much emphasis on treating others with the sort of respect that we would like to be given, you’d think that inequality would be a non-issue. Obviously that’s not the case.</p>

<p>For centuries, we humans—even those of us who ascribe to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Religion_and_philosophy">these and the other countless Golden Rule abiding religions and philosophies</a>—have failed to recognize ourselves in others and have erected barriers (both physical and societal) to their ability to lead the sort of happy, fulfilled life that we want for ourselves and our families.</p>

<p>Almost every way we mistreat others—from rude or snarky comments to genocide—stems from our inability to empathize with another person or group of people. It’s hard to connect with people who are different than us—people who have different life experiences, people who have different perspectives, people who are challenged in ways we have never been—and when we struggle to create a connection, it becomes easy for us to view them as “the other”. And when we begin to look at other people this way, we lose sight of their humanity and we lose sight of all of the things that make us similar.</p>

<p>While it is completely true that I have a very different life than a woman growing up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi">Dharavi</a>, I have to believe that we have a lot in common too. We both want a good life for our families. We both want to feel safe. We both crack jokes. We’re both human. Our respective societies may view us very differently, but she is no less valuable than I am.</p>

<p>And this is why I am so passionate about the philosophy of egalitarianism. It grounds us in the notion that we are all equally valuable and should be granted equal opportunity to all that life has to offer.</p>

<hr>


<p>John Rawls has a great thought experiment that I often cite in <a href="http://vimeo.com/70018634">my talks on empathy</a>. In it, he would ask you to imagine your ideal society. It could be a monarchy, anarchy, capitalist, or communist. It could be ruled by people of one particular gender or color. It could be governed by people of a particular tribe. It could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Panem">Panem</a>. It could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon">Erewhon</a>. It could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brobdingnag">Brobdingnag</a>. The choice is yours.</p>

<p>Once you’ve been ruminating on this a bit, he drops the bombshell: You have no control over or knowledge of where you fit in this society. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance">Veil of Ignorance</a>, a creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harsanyi">John Harsanyi</a> (an economist and early father of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>). Rawls found that, with the Veil of Ignorance in play, people who participated in this thought experiment gravitated toward creating the most egalitarian societies possible.</p>

<p>It makes complete sense: What rational human being would create a society that enslaves people if they themselves could turn out to be a slave? Who would create a society that excludes women if they might be female? Who would build a world full of stairs if they could be in a wheelchair?</p>

<p>I love this exercise because it makes it easy to create at least basic connections between you and a wide variety of people who are different than you. It helps you realize that we are all equal and all worthy of consideration.</p>

<hr>


<p>What is interesting about egalitarianism, as opposed to similar sounding philosophies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto">modern communism</a>, is that it recognizes that equality of opportunity does not necessitate equality of outcome. In other words, while pushing for equality,  it simultaneously recognizes that we have differences in capability, capacity, and interest.</p>

<p>We are different. We are similar in more ways than we are different, but to ignore our differences is to deny us our  individuality, our personhood, our true selves. But recognizing differences is not the same as assigning a value to those differences. That’s an incredibly important distinction and bears repeating: Just because you recognize that someone is different does not imply you should view or treat them as any more or less human on account of what makes them different. That said, recognizing differences is the first step towards being able to create equality of opportunity.</p>

<p>This is such an important concept in life, but I was not a philosophy major, so I’ll stick to discussing it in terms of what I know a lot about: The Web. Specifically, Web accessibility.</p>

<p>For a great many of us, ensuring our websites are accessible is an afterthought. We talk a good game when it comes to “user centered” this or that, but often treat the word “accessibility” as a synonym for “screen reader”. It’s so much more than that. “Accessibility” is about people. People consume content and use interfaces in many different ways, some similar and some not so similar to how we do it.</p>

<p>Sure, people with visual impairments often use a screen reader to consume content. They might also use a braille touch feedback device or a braille printer. They probably also use a keyboard. Or they may use a touchscreen in concert with audio cues. And yes, visual impairment affects a great percentage of people, but they are only part of the “accessibility” puzzle.</p>

<p>The dimensions of interactive elements—links, buttons, etc.—and their proximity to one another is an important factor in ensuring an interface actually registers our intent (i.e. it helps us avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error">fat fingering</a>). <em>Design</em> is an accessibility concern.</p>

<p>The color contrast between text and the background is an important factor in ensuring content remains readable in different lighting situations. <em>Color</em> is an accessibility concern.</p>

<p>The language we use on our sites and in our interfaces directly affects how easy it is for our users to understand what we do, the products we are offering, and why it matters. It also affects how we make our users feel. <em>Language</em> is an accessibility concern.</p>

<p>The size of our Web pages and their associated assets has a direct affect on how long our pages take to download, how much it costs our customers to access them, and (sometimes) even whether or not the content can be reached. <em>Performance</em> is an accessibility concern.</p>

<p>I could keep going, but I’m sure you’re starting to get the point. “Accessibility” is ultimately about ensuring people have equal opportunity to access your content while simultaneously recognizing that we all have special needs—physical limitations, bandwidth limitations, device limitations, etc.—that lead us to have different experiences of the same Web page.</p>

<p>Accessibility <em>is</em> egalitarianism.</p>

<hr>


<p>We are all different, but we all human. We all deserve respect. We all deserve to be treated equally. To be treated fairly.</p>

<p>We need more egalitarianism in this world and the good news is that <em>we</em> can make it happen.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Spelling Errors, Exclusions, and Packages, Oh My—Working Drafts at the W3C]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/spelling-errors-exclusions-and-packages-oh-my/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-16T07:15:12-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/spelling-errors-exclusions-and-packages-oh-my</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week the W3C published a couple of really cool new Working Drafts I wanted to bring to your attention (just in case you missed them).</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-pseudo-4-20150115">CSS 4 Pseudo-elements</a>.</h2>

<p>Most of this is stuff you know: <code>::first-line</code>, <code>::first-letter</code>, and <code>::selection</code>. But what magic is this? <code>::spelling-error</code> and <code>::grammar-error</code> too! What?! Now I know I may be a little too excited about this, but it’s not because spelling and grammar errors are going to solve all of our design problems; I am excited about this because it points to us being granted more control over how more of the internals of browser operations are rendered to our users.</p>

<p>Obviously <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/native-vs-stylable-tug-of-war/">this is a double edged sword</a> and could be abused to the detriment of the user experience, but it may also lead to someone coming up with clearer conventions for indicating spelling and grammar errors than the ones we’ve been using since the early days of Microsoft Word.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/">CSS 3 Exclusions</a></h2>

<p>This has been a long time coming. The idea is pretty simple: Within a flow-type element (think <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>, etc.) you can apply <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/#wrap-flow-property">the <code>wrap-flow</code> property</a> to children in order to control where content can go in relation to them. Here’s an example from the spec:</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-01-16-1">
    <img src="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/images/exclusions-illustration.png" alt="Four boxes layed out roughly diagonally from the upper left to the lower right within a larger container. A flow of blue color shows where text is allowed to flow.">
</figure>


<p>In this example, child A is set to <code>wrap-flow: both</code>, allowing content to flow on both sides of it. Child B is set to <code>wrap-flow: start</code> meaning content should only be allowed on the starting side of the element (based on text direction, in this case left to right). Child C is set to <code>wrap-flow: end</code> meaning content can only appear after it in terms of text-direction. And child D is set to <code>wrap-flow: clear</code> which, as you might expect based on your existing CSS knowledge, ensures no content appears on either side of it.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/#wrap-flow-property">another, more thorough example in the Working Draft</a> (scroll down a little bit), but it uses grid layout as well and is a little more complicated that I want to get into today.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the equation, there is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css3-exclusions-20150115/#wrap-through-property">the <code>wrap-through</code> property</a> which allows other elements to control whether or not they pay attention to the <code>wrap-flow</code> property of another element. A <code>wrap-through</code> value of &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; adheres to what they are calling the &ldquo;wrapping context&rdquo; of the parent element (which basically means it behaves as you’d expect, being a child element). Setting a <code>wrap-through</code> value of &ldquo;none&rdquo; on the child element, however, would make it ignore the parent element’s wrapping context and allow this child’s content to flow through (hence <code>wrap-through</code>) the excluded element.</p>

<p>It’s a lot to take in and (of course) still subject to change, but I just wanted to bring this concept to your attention as it is pretty cool stuff and is a nice complement to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-shapes-1/">CSS Shapes</a>, which landed early last year.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-web-packaging-20150115/">Streamable Package Format</a></h2>

<p>This one is pretty crazy and I am still tucking into it, but here’s the gist: You could provide a &ldquo;package&rdquo; or rolled up collection of files necessary to render your page—think CSS, images, fonts, etc.—in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-web-packaging-20150115/#streamable-package-format">Streamable Package Format</a> which would allow a browser to download them all in one go rather than having to request each resource individually. This could be really useful from a performance standpoint on high-latency connections as it cuts down on the number of round-trips the browser must make to the server before it can render the page. And, since the package can be streamed, we can optimize the contents to provide the most important bits first so the browser can go about rendering the document as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This is a very cool concept with a lot of potential benefit to our users. Of course, as the document acknowledges, it’s also possible to abuse this and adversely affect performance by including a lot of unnecessary content. Kinda like <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/articles/spa.html">that guy who made his whole single-page app into a Web Component</a>. Just because you can do something doesn’t make it a good idea.</p>

<p>Still, there’s a lot of potential here and I’m excited to see where it goes.</p>

<hr>


<p>Now the caveat: all of these are Working Drafts, not Technical Recommendations, so <em>they are not final by any means</em>. That said, they do point to a pretty interesting not to distant future.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[An Onslaught of Low-cost Smartphones]]></title>
				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-onslaught-of-low-cost-smartphones/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-15T11:58:11-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-onslaught-of-low-cost-smartphones</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems every week we are seeing more and more low-cost devices being launched in an effort to connect the unconnected. For instance, this past week  saw the announcement of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7544107/microsoft-lumia-435-532-launch-specs-price-release-date">two new entries in the Microsoft Lumia line, the 435 and the 532</a>, and the announcement of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/samsung-finally-puts-tizen-on-a-smartphone-launches-the-z1-in-india/">Samsung’s first Tizen phone, the Z1</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The two Lumia devices are the cheapest Windows Phone offerings to date: The Lumia 435 is €69 (about US$80) and the Lumia 532 is just slightly more expensive at €79 (about US$94). By comparison, the Lumia 535 was the previous low-cost Windows Phone winner at US$135. And Samsung’s Z1, which is aimed at the Indian market, runs a mere Rs 5,700 (roughly US$92).</p>

<p>Now if you’ve read this far, you are probably wondering why this matters. Well, spec-wise, many of these lower-end devices are far from what we are used to. All of these devices are running a resolution of 800×480. And their processing speeds are slower than the device you likely have in your pocket. But they are all far cheaper too. And remember that people in China and India have <a href="#fig-2015-01-15-01">far less disposible income than we do</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-01-15-01" class="media-container">
    <img src="http://aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2014-11-06/05-sm.jpg"
         srcset="/i/posts/2014-11-06/05-lg.jpg 1920w, /i/posts/2014-11-06/05-md.jpg 600w, /i/posts/2014-11-06/05-sm.jpg 320w"
         alt="A bar chart comparing the average monthly incomes of people living in the U.S., Canada, China, and India."
         >
</figure>


<p>If you only earned US$295 a month, a US$799 smartphone would likely be out of the question.</p>

<p>As Web designers and developers, we need to expose ourselves to the Web as others see it. This is why we need to view our sites and applications on lower-end devices and over lower-speed—2G, 3G, etc.—connections. Only by testing our wares can we truly ensure our content and services are available and accessible by anyone, anywhere, on any device. You know, <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/">the vision for the Web</a>.</p>

<p>Of course you probably don’t have the budget to purchase a bunch of devices, no matter how cheap they are. So how do you test on them? <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">Visit a local Open Device Lab</a> like <a href="http://chadevicelab.org">the one we have here in Chattanooga</a>. Or if you don’t have one near you, consider getting together with some colleagues and <a href="http://lab-up.org/">starting an ODL in your area</a>.</p>

I finally took a few minutes to formally bust out the links into <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/">their own paginated section</a>, so you can keep up with them independently. I also set up a three distinct Atom feeds to let you consume this site’s content how you want to: <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/atom.xml">Latest 20 posts and links</a>, <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/atom-latest-posts.xml">latest 20 posts</a>, and <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/atom-latest-links.xml">Latest 20 links</a>.</p>

				<link href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/webos-is-back/"/>
				<updated>2015-01-08T10:17:09-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/webos-is-back</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may not remember it, but Palm’s groundbreaking—yes, I said groundbreaking—operating system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">webOS</a>, has been resuscitated yet again. This time by LG.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For those of you who may have missed out on webOS in the past, here’s a primer: webOS was developed by Palm and debuted on the Palm Pre in 2009. It was the first “HTML5-based” operating system. Yes you read that right: the OS was built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In 2009. Six. Years. Ago.</p>

<p>Applications for webOS were written using the front-end Web stack, with the JavaScript application logic tied into the device via the Mojo—and later Enyo—JavaScript application framework. Though novel at the time, this concept has since taken off in the intervening years. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn631758.aspx">Windows</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/">Firefox OS</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=build%20native%20apps%20with%20html5">countless “unified” native app development platforms</a> have embraced the front-end Web stack as a means of building software.</p>

<p>webOS also supported multitasking, which was not common back then. And to make it easy to manage, webOS introduced the brilliant card metaphor for viewing and switching between running applications. Apple, of course, ripped that idea off for iOS 7. If you dig that feature on your iPhone you have Palm to thank.</p>

<p>Sadly, Palm usage was on the decline when webOS debuted so operating system never really took off. Eventually Palm was engulfed by HP, which launched the ill-fated HP TouchPad. It too failed to gather any steam and we thought webOS was dead (despite many proclamations to the contrary from well-meaning folks at HP).</p>

<p>In 2013 <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4027814/hp-emerges-as-big-winner-in-webos-sale">HP announced it was selling parts of webOS to LG</a> for use in smart TVs. It was a glimmer of hope for the beleaguered OS. And now, not only do we have webOS based <a href="http://www.lg.com/uk/smarttv/webos">smart TVs</a>, but <a href="http://gizmodo.com/lgs-new-smart-watch-is-powered-by-webos-1678191522">LG’s new smart watches are sporting the OS as well</a>. And LG has not ruled out bringing it back for a phone either.</p>

<p>I’m happy to see webOS sticking around. It may have been the laughing stock in the app development community back in the day, but I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for it.</p>

It was an immediate hit and the response to continues to be tremendous even though it will turn four this coming May (which has to be like 80 in technology book years… many are outdated before they are even released).</p>

<p>I think one of the main reasons the book has remained relevant for so long is because at its core, <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> is a <em>philosophy</em> book. Sure, there are some code examples here and there, but they only serve to demonstrate how you can apply progressive enhancement in your work. The philosophy of progressive enhancement works and only continues to demonstrate its brilliance with each new Web-enabled screen that debuts in the ever-expanding global marketplace. In fact, I’ll go out on a limb and declare that progressive enhancement is probably even more relevant today than it was when I wrote <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> in 2010.</p>

<p>As such, I’ve been thinking a lot about an update. So much has happened since mid-2010 when I was writing the book. Heck, I didn’t even address Responsive Web Design and only touched a little on mobile. Then there are things like single-page apps &amp; isomorphic JavaScript I’d love to discuss. <a href="http://opengraphprotocol.org/">Open Graph</a> &amp; <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>… new tweaks to <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">the ARIA spec</a>… <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element"><code>picture</code></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#attr-img-srcset"><code>srcset</code></a> &amp; <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#attr-img-sizes"><code>sizes</code></a>… the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/">shadow DOM</a>… <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/">web components</a>… the list goes on and on. Progressive enhancement can help you better understand the pros and cons of all of these new advances and help you employ them while simultaneously keeping your projects on time and on budget.</p>

<p>My hope is that the second edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> will be out an in your hands by the end of 2015. But in the meantime, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/4956">taking a page from Jeremy</a>, I felt it was time to give away the first edition. You can now <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/">read <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite></a>, in it’s entirety, from the comfort of your own browser… for free.</p>

<p>The HTML version of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite> is a nearly direct port of the XHTML I wrote for the hand-coded ePub. I made a few tweaks to make it a little more readable in the browser, but it’s all there including the videos. And yes, it makes use of progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it and I look forward to getting you the revised and expanded second edition in the not to distant future.</p>

<p>PS &ndash; Easy Readers closed up shop at the end of 2014 and delivered the remaining paperback copies—of which there are only 50 or so—to me. If you missed out on getting a copy and would like to purchase one, <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/contact/">drop me a line</a> and I can sell you one. I’ll even sign it for you!</p>
