<pre><code>https://m.facebook.com/ClydesOnMain?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FClydesOnMain#!/ClydesOnMain?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FClydesOnMain
</code></pre>

<p>Wonder what’s going on? Well, Facebook’s mobile site (<code>m.facebook.com/ClydesOnMain</code>) is tracking the URL (using the <code>refsrc</code> GET parameter) I came from (<code>www.facebook.com/ClydesOnMain#!/ClydesOnMain</code>)—a single page &ldquo;web app&rdquo;, hence the hash-bang: <code>#!</code>—that was tracking the original referral page (<code>www.facebook.com/ClydesOnMain</code>).</p>

<p>I hope they got all that.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In watching <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-atari-game-over/"><cite>Atari: Game Over</cite></a>, I couldn&rsquo;t help but see all of the parallels between the early video game industry and the web design industry. The boys’ club… Engineers as rockstars… It&rsquo;s a tale of a meteoric commercial rise followed by a swift and dismal collapse.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The film centers around the urban legend of millions of <cite>E.T. The Videogame</cite> cartridges being buried in a landfill in New Mexico as Atari burying it&rsquo;s shame over producing such a bad video game. Many cite <cite>E.T. The Videogame</cite> as the reason for the collapse of the industry in 1983, but it wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>

<p>Xbox co-creator <a href="https://twitter.com/seamusblackley">Seamus Blackley</a> offered this:</p>

<blockquote><p>The behavior patterns that created the conditions for the E.T. failure is what destroyed the video game industry.</p></blockquote>

<p>The behavior patterns in question: greed; ridiculous timelines (E.T. was conceived and programmed in 5 weeks by one man: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Scott_Warshaw">Howard Scott Warshaw</a>); and hubris.</p>

<p>There are a lot of parallels with the Silicon Valley of today. Food for thought.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Anyway <a href="http://aka.ms/ktlsyd">//build/</a>, the Microsoft conference, is going on right now and as you’d expect, there are a ton of new announcements. I’ve watched a few of the talks virtualy and am particularly excited about the new browser (whose name has finally been revealed): <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/browser-for-doing">Microsoft Edge</a>. I’m also very interested to see where things go with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">HoloLens</a>.</p>

<p>One graphic that cropped up that blew my mind was this one talking about where Windows 10 is going:</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-04-30-01" class="media-container"><img alt="The Windows 10 continuum from an Internet of Things board up to a SurfaceHub and HoloLens"  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://news.microsoft.com/build2015/assets/photos/build720150428_web.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://news.microsoft.com/build2015/assets/photos/build720150428_web.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://news.microsoft.com/build2015/assets/photos/build720150428_web.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://news.microsoft.com/build2015/assets/photos/build720150428_web.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw"></figure>


<p>You’ve often heard me discuss <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/chapter-1.html">experience as a continuum</a>. Microsoft is living it.</p>

<p>If you didn’t watch the streaming talks and want to hear about what was announced from some independent sources, I’d recommend reading these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/microsoft-build-hololens/">Microsoft Shows HoloLens’ Augmented Reality Is No Gimmick</a> — <cite>Wired</cite>
A good overview of the possibilities of HoloLens with a recap of what was shown. I caught this demo on the lifestream. It was pretty impressive. I can’t wait to try a HoloLens myself.</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/04/30/microsoft-opens-up-applications-for-developers-to-test-ios-and-android-app-conversion-tools/">Microsoft opens up applications for developers to test iOS and Android app conversion tools</a> — <cite>The Next Web</cite>
The Microsoft App Store is a little scant on first-rate programs right now, so in a play to make it stupid-simple for iOS and Android developers to run on Windows 10, the folks at Microsoft have built a conversion tool that ports the app for you. It’s worth noting that you can also port a website into a native Windows app. Smart move on Microsoft’s part if you ask me.</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/04/30/hands-on-with-the-new-minimalist-microsoft-edge-browser/">Hands-on: The new Microsoft Edge browser is a picture of minimalism</a> — <cite>The Next Web</cite>
Obviously the web is where I live and work. I’ve been playing with early builds of the new Microsoft browser for a few months now and have been pretty happy with its speed and capabilities, but it is nice to read an outside perspective on it.</li>
<li><a href="http://gizmodo.com/microsoft-just-nonchalantly-showed-us-the-single-device-1701020050">Microsoft Just Nonchalantly Showed Us the Single-Device UI of the Future</a>
I don’t know about &ldquo;nonchalantly&rdquo;, but the whole Continuum feature is pretty amazing. The potential for being able to use the computer in your pocket with other peripherals is pretty intriguing. Imagine using your phone, a set of holographic or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cinemizer-1909-127-Multimedia-Video-Glasses/dp/B0091OI530/">virtual screen glasses</a>, and a bluetooth keyboard &amp; mouse to get work done on a plane. No need to worry about someone leaning back and breaking your laptop!</li>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/30/hololens-is-real/">HoloLens Hands-On: How We Built An App For Microsoft’s Augmented Reality Headset</a><br/>
One reporter’s experience developing for and playing with HoloLens. Sounds like it was pretty cool. I wonder if it can be tweaked to work for people with poor vision like me or if it fits nicely over glasses.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/microsofts-one-billion-device-vision-genius-next-impossible/">Microsoft’s Windows 10 Vision Isn’t As Simple as It Seems</a><br/>
A deeper analysis of Microsoft’s play for more developer (and consumer) mindshare.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>I will continue adding to this list as new &amp; interesting pieces come out</em>.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Lies, Damn Lies, and JavaScript]]></title>
				<link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/lies-damn-lies-and-javascript/"/>
				<updated>2015-04-27T15:10:11-04:00</updated>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late last week I stumbled on a video from <a href="https://twitter.com/graemepyle">Graeme Pyle</a> that exposed a UX lie in the <a href="https://www.fnb.co.za/">First National Bank of South Africa</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><figure id="fig-gpBWwl-Ngak" class="figure figure--video"><div class="video-embed video-embed--youtube video-embed--4x3"><a class="video-embed__lazy-link" style="background-image:url(http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/gpBWwl-Ngak/0.jpg)" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBWwl-Ngak" data-lazy-video-src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gpBWwl-Ngak?autoplay=1"><div class="video-embed__lazy-div"></div><div class="video-embed__lazy-info">Shocking discovery: fnb.co.za progress bar a placebo!</div></a></div></figure></p>

<p>On the off chance you don’t want to watch the video, I’ll recap: When accessing certain screens on the FNB site, a progress meter is shown to indicate new content is being flowed into the browser. But it’s not.</p>

<p>As Graeme uncovered, the site uses JavaScript to create the progress bar, but the progress is not tied to anything except some basic JavaScript logic. The progress bar has no grounding in reality. It uses timeouts and follows a steady incrementation for a bit, then jumps up randomly for a bit before finishing.</p>

<p>Taking the easy way out like this may seem like a non-issue, but what happens when your user loses network connectivity? You guessed it: The progress meter still runs. <em>Doh!</em></p>

<p>Tracking true activity progress (like time to upload a file) involves constant communication between the server and the client. It used to be pretty difficult to do (and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lgoddard/CGI-ProgressBar-0.05/lib/CGI/ProgressBar.pm">required Perl</a>), but nowadays we have <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">WebSockets</a> and it’s much easier to keep the lines of communication between client and server open.</p>

<p>There is no reason to fake a progress bar. It’s pointless. Especially when you don’t even check to see if the user’s connection is still online.</p>
