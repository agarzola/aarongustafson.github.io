				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new site, <a href="http://breakupwithie8.com/">Break Up with Internet Explorer 8</a> by <a href="http://www.humaan.com/">Humaan</a>, has been making the rounds on the Interwebs of late. It’s cleverly done and an attractive site, but I don’t really agree with the premise:</p>

<blockquote><p>Join the intervention and stop supporting IE8. It&rsquo;s time for an upgrade.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>The reality is that some users don’t have control over the browsers installed on their computers and <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2224510/microsoft-subnet/some-windows-xp-users-just-can-t-afford-to-upgrade.html">IE8 may be the best they can muster</a>. Most of us have had the luxury of moving on, but they haven’t. Does that mean we should banish those users from our sites by treating IE8 like that ex who just won’t take a hint? I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Instead, we should approach this problem rationally. Be the bigger person. Call it <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/">support vs. optimization</a>, call it <a href="http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard">cutting the mustard</a>, call it what you will, but by understanding how browsers work, we can reduce our own development headaches and serve more users in the process. Yes, even when they use aging browsers like IE8 or IE7 or (gasp) IE6.</p>

<p>When it comes to HTML and CSS, browsers ignore what they don’t understand. It’s why you can use the <code>section</code> element and the content will still be exposed in Lynx. It’s also why you can use RGBa without IE6 collapsing. <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/chapter-1.html#the-rise-of-tolerance">Fault tolerance is a really powerful tool</a> and is the foundation of progressive enhancement in HTML and CSS. (In JavaScript things are a little more complicated… we have to use <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/feature-browser-detection/">feature detection</a>.)</p>

<p>A simple way to rid yourself of IE8 related headaches is to embrace the idea that <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">web pages don’t need to look (or behave) the same in every browser</a> and look for ways to achieve this while still providing access to your content and tools for less-capable browsers and devices. For example:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/b9bca995a67ba298225d.js?file=css-filter.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;simple.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;complex.css&quot; media=&quot;only screen&quot;&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This simple stylesheet setup will deliver only the <code>simple.css</code> file to browsers that are incapable of understanding media queries. Browsers that do understand them will get both stylesheets. Media queries support is an easy line in the sand we can draw because <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu/79">lack of media query support is in fact the first media query</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, it’s as simple as putting all of your advanced styles in the <code>complex.css</code> file. No drama.</p>

<p>On the JavaScript end, you can draw a line in the sand too. Let’s say you don’t want to spend your time debugging JavaScript in IE8. You can just skip it using <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">Conditional Comments</a>:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/b9bca995a67ba298225d.js?file=js-filter.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;not-for-ie8.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Using an approach like this avoids delivering the contained JavaScript files to IE8 at all, but all other browsers will see them.</p>

<p>If that’s too drastic, use <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/feature-browser-detection/">feature detection</a> in your JavaScript files to determine if it is safe to rely on a particular method or capability. Program defensively.</p>

<p>Honestly, I’ve found that approaches like these lead to fewer grey hairs and a lower overall stress level. They make me a happier developer and let me concentrate on building for the future rather than worrying about the past.</p>

<p>But it’s not about breaking up with IE8, it’s about having a realistic and honest relationship with it.</p>

				<title type="html"><![CDATA[Who Should Pay 2: The Hosting]]></title>
				<link href="http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/who-should-pay-2-the-hosting/"/>
				<updated>2015-03-06T08:39:15-05:00</updated>
				<id>http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/who-should-pay-2-the-hosting</id>
				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I argued that our <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/who-should-pay/">users should never foot the bill for developer convenience</a> and yesterday I stumbled on a post from EllisLab (the makers of ExpressionEngine) that echoes that sentiment, but from a different angle. The title might make you scratch your head: <a href="https://ellislab.com/blog/entry/save-thousands-of-dollars-by-paying-more-for-hosting">Save Thousands of Dollars by Paying More for Hosting</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>While it sounds counterintuitive, EllisLab’s statement makes sense. It’s all about shifting your perspective from agonizing over every hard cost on the balance sheet to thinking “big picture” about how you are spending your money overall.</p>

<p>Their post makes the case that a low-cost hosting may be cheaper on the surface, but its slow performance will end up costing you more in terms of productivity loss and/or actual billable hours. The comparison they use is modest, but with a big impact: GoDaddy at $59.88/year vs. Nexcess at $8.95/month (still inexpensive, but roughly 2x the cost).</p>

<blockquote><p>Normally, the ExpressionEngine control panel is fast. Zippy even. There aren’t many pages in the control panel that should have an execution time of more than a second. Most pages take a fraction of a second, no fancy caching needed. It’s common to see this in the footer: &ldquo;Script executed in 0.0706 seconds.&rdquo; Sure, add-ons that are bad citizens can slow down the control panel, but typically not to the degree a bad host can.</p>

<p>How about ten seconds per page? No joke, on a recent site we logged in to on GoDaddy, one of the faster pages in the Admin area took ten seconds. The Template Manager took fifteen seconds, the publish page twenty-plus. I felt terrible for the developer and client who were using this site daily. Not only were they having a terrible experience with our software, they were <em>losing money</em> and didn’t even know it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The post then proceeds to work through some estimations of normal workload in the CMS to determine how much money is quietly being drained from a project’s kitty because of a poor hosting decision. I won’t lie, it’s substantial.</p>

<p>Now the EllisLab post is focused more on agency and project costs, but the implications of a slow host extend to our end users too.</p>

<p>Sure, a slow host will delay the delivery of our content and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">increase the likelihood they will go to a competitor</a>. That’s a given. But a slow host can also drain a mobile device’s battery (because the radio must be kept on longer), which reduces the usefulness of their device.</p>

<p>Slow servers are also incredibly frustrating for users and are inconsiderate of their time. This is one of the points I was harping on in my post: we should not value our time above our customers’ time. When we put our customers’ needs above our own, we make better products and (ultimately) better decisions for our businesses.</p>

<p>Long story short: Shop around for a good price on a speedy server. Your developers, content creators, and (most importantly) your customers will thank you for it.</p>
