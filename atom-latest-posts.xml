				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jason Garber has penned a series of posts on progressive enhancement. Here’s a quick rundown on what they cover and why you should read them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="http://sixtwothree.org/posts/designing-experience-layers">Designing Experience Layers</a></h2>

<p>In his first post, Jason picks up on a drumbeat I’ve been hammering on for years: we need to consider experience a continuum, not a monolithic thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today’s Web makes no guarantees. Every bit of code—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—shipped from a server across the wire acts as a suggestion as to how the browser should interpret and display content. More often than not, everything works planned, but for any number of reasons, a browser could fail to request or render a particular asset.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, get to know <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/chapter-1.html#adapt-or-die">fault tolerance as it applies to web design</a> and <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/">don’t make any assumptions about how your content will be rendered/experienced</a>.</p>

<p>His conclusion is an important one:</p>

<blockquote><p>Approaching design through the lens of experience layers is the design strategy for the Web; one that’s better for users and designers alike.</p></blockquote>

<p>Amen!</p>

<h2><a href="http://sixtwothree.org/posts/in-defense-of-progressive-enhancement">In Defense of Progressive Enhancement</a></h2>

<p>In his follow-up, Jason defends his position against <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/designing-experience-layers#comment-1847156038">a lengthy comment from his supervisor at Viget</a>. Jason’s responses are dead on:</p>

<ol>
<li>JavaScript is not a baseline (or a given) and</li>
<li>When large sites put their eggs in the JS basket, they set a bad example for other developers.</li>
</ol>


<p>His summation is perfect:</p>

<blockquote><p>I remain unconvinced that abandoning progressive enhancement in favor of JavaScript-first development is better for users or is the direction the Web is inevitably heading. It’s our responsibility to do right by the billions already online and the next billion preparing to come online. We can achieve this by designing robust, resilient, layered experiences using techniques like progressive enhancement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, fantastic.</p>

<h2><a href="http://sixtwothree.org/posts/the-practical-case-for-progressive-enhancement">The Practical Case for Progressive Enhancement</a></h2>

<p>Continuing the thread, Jason assembles more reasons to adopt the progressive enhancement philosophy.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The “Moral” Argument for Progressive Enhancement</strong> &ndash; Personally, I think Jason gives in too easily on this. Access to content is <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/topics/digital-divide/">a social justice issue</a> and that is nothing to gloss over. In some cases it is also a <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">legal requirement</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The “Cost” of Progressive Enhancement</strong> &ndash; Jason does a good job addressing the costs (monetarily and temporally) associated with adopting progressive enhancement in terms of building, testing, and supporting websites. As he says, it is more costly to &ldquo;bolt on&rdquo; accessibility and progressive enhancement at the end of a project. He is also correct in his assertion that progressively-enhanced websites actually require less testing. And when you <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/">draw a stark line between support and optimization</a>, support for additional browsers and devices also becomes far less costly. What Jason was missing was numbers to back all this up. <a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/">I have those numbers</a>. Enjoy.</li>
<li><strong>Practicality</strong> &ndash; Finally, Jason calls out games and their ilk as edge cases. He correctly asserts that the vast majority of properties on the Web could easily be built following progressive enhancement. Sure, you might not build a Photoshop clone using progressive enhancement, but how many of you are building an image editor for the Web? I didn’t think so.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In all, this was a nice little series. Great work Jason! If you want to dig into this progressive enhancement stuff a bit more, you can read the entirety of my award-winning book <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/"><cite>Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences with Progressive Enhancement</cite> online, for free</a>.</p>

				<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monday, February 2nd will be the start of a new chapter in my professional career: I will joining Microsoft as a standards evangelist.</p>

<p><em>Wha?!</em></p>

<p>The reasons for the move are manifold, but I will do my best to summarize by taking you on the journey I’ve been on and hopefully that will help you understand why I will be leaving agency life behind and joining a browser maker (and the makers of Internet Explorer at that).</p>

<!-- more -->




<hr>


<p>I’ve been working on the Web since 1996. That’s nearly 20 years of building everything from simple marketing campaign sites to emails to complex transactional websites and custom content management systems. In that time, I’ve gained skills on both the front end and the back end and rolled the 10,000 hour odometer at least a couple of times.</p>

<p>It’s been great. I love building things and I love helping our amazing clients put awesome information and services on the Web. But at the same time, I’ve enjoyed working with teams to help <em>them</em> solve their own problems even more than I’ve enjoyed solving them directly. It’s why I love speaking at conferences and running workshops: I love to see the lightbulbs come on over people’s heads!</p>

<p>Over the last few years, <a href="http://easy-designs.net">Kelly and I</a> have made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of production work we’ve been doing in favor of more consulting. And early last year we came to a sort of crossroads: We knew we could keep doing what we’d been doing and things would be good, but we weren’t feeling challenged anymore.</p>

<p>And so we began to brainstorm ideas of what we’d like to do in the next phase of our lives.</p>

<hr>


<p>Kelly came to the Web from an education and community organizing background, so she wanted to find a way to incorporate those with her technical knowledge. And about two months ago, she got that opportunity and she took a position as the Program Manager for <a href="http://techgoeshomecha.org/">Tech Goes Home Chattanooga</a>, an organization committed to bridging the digital divide in our fair city.</p>

<p>When I close my eyes and think about what makes me happiest, it’s writing, speaking, and spreading the word about web design best practices. The folks I know who get to do that full-time tend to be developer evangelists (or <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a>). And so I began pondering that possibility.</p>

<p>As I went through the list of browser makers in my mind, Microsoft stuck out.</p>

<p>Some of you might think that’s odd. I mean come on, IE has been the red-headed stepchild of the web design world for the better part of a decade. Why on earth would I want to work there?</p>

<p>Well, I’ll tell you: Despite its market largesse, IE (and in many ways Microsoft) is operating like the scrappy upstart. And I root for underdogs.</p>

<hr>


<p>I think back to the early days of the Web when I would need a Windows license for every virtual machine I wanted to run in order to test each browser version. It was a pain in the ass and made me curse Microsoft on a regular basis.</p>

<p>But things have changed. A lot.</p>

<p>A few years back, the IE team launched <a href="http://modern.ie">modern.IE</a>, an awesome resource with VMs that were free for the taking. They also launched <a href="https://www.modern.ie/en-us/report">a free tool for identifying coding issues and checking cross-browser interoperability</a>. Then they opened up <a href="http://status.modern.ie">the roadmap for standards implementations in IE</a>. And just recently they gave us <a href="https://remote.modern.ie/">RemoteIE</a> and did away with the need for VMs altogether (at least to test our stuff on the latest version of IE).</p>

<p>This is a very different Microsoft.</p>

<p>Now sure, there’s still more they could open up, but this is progress. Big ships are slow to turn, but this ship is turning.</p>

<p>I want to be a part of that.</p>

<hr>


<p>I will be joining Microsoft as a “Senior Program Manager”, but titles don’t matter much to me. I see my job boiling down to a few key things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Helping web designers and developers better understand the possibilities of the Web;</li>
<li>Advocating for interoperable, accessible web design best practices;</li>
<li>Being a voice for the web design and development community to communicate their needs to the IE team in order to improve the browser; and</li>
<li>Being an internal advocate for Web standards implementations in other Microsoft products (think Visual Studio, Outlook, Word).</li>
</ol>


<p>Microsoft is not hiring me to be a salesman—<em>thank god, they’d be pretty disappointed</em>—they are hiring me to continue being me. I will continue writing, I will continue speaking, and I will continue educating. The only thing that has changed is that I can spend all of my time doing that, rather than having to balance it with client work.</p>

<hr>


<p>So Monday starts a new chapter in my career. It’s a little scary (I haven’t worked for someone else for over a decade), but it is also exciting. I am comforted by the fact that I am joining an amazing team: As he announced yesterday, <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2015/01/29/on-towards-my-next-challenge-2/">Christian Heilmann will also join Microsoft on the 2nd</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAIPCp_BOGU">charismatic Rey Bango</a> will be leading our merry little conga line.</p>

<p>I’m excited about the future and I’m thrilled to be given the opportunity to focus on making the Web better… for everyone.</p>
